Ich mag die Farben
Bei mir kommts aufs Spiel drauf an. Manche suchte ich übelst durch und manche nicht 😅 schöne Woche liebes ❤️
Bei mir dauert es immer ewig bis ich ein Spiel durch habe
Also bei Borderlands  zb nehm wir uns Zeit...machen auch erst nebenquests guck 1000x Waffen durch usw😅 und Spiel halt auch gern was anderes zwischendurch zb Ow oder Ctr
Sehr vom Spiel abhängig. Marvels Spider-Man hab ich z.B. nahezu in einem Zug zu 100% weginhaliert. 😅 Bei BL3 nehm ich mir insgesamt mehr Zeit.
Liked your post mind liking mine💯

Mine arrived yesterday - welcome to the slippery expensive slope of VGM! 😂
Wait so is this supposed to be a pvp roll or pve?
@ivanespinosa_ca pve firing lane will be really good because of the buff to snipers
Can this sniper roll with snapshot and opening shot??
@s1ut4chrispratt yeah
@b_maxey_12 thank u
Still waiting to get that perk, it’s been so dam elusive 🤦🏻‍♂️
@_dgo_562 but with snap?

🙏Dope! Can you comment on my new post?
@noahbriton No, i dont think i will
Same roll for me 👍🏾
I was wondering if someone could dm me and explain what I get for buying the standard shadowkeep edition I’m a bit confused 👍🏻
wait ur playing destiny???
Pretty sick shader
That’s a nice roll
Pvp- 7/10 need a range masterwork and full choke as that’s better than rifled barrel
@dxrksteel.247 no he has the picture sent to him and the people could have the pics anytime taken and sent to him.
@suausj1 oh

That looks in really nice condition. I still need this one 👍
@stumotor33na3rd I've had this for years and it still looks good today!
Nice one looks mint like mine and nice poster👌🔥turtle power
@segasaibot thanks 😁
This poster dude! 😎 Awesome. Actually, I didn't knew a poster of this game existed 👍 As always, some can't stop arguing about what version is the best between the Super NES or the Genesis, blah blah blah... To them I'll just answer: "Go get both!" 🍕 And play the Genesis/Megadrive for an experience that's closer to the arcade.
Yes !! Have you played the new Mario kart app??
@itsnerdculture yeah, but for me it's trash 😭
@dwatzi yeah they need to fix the steering and throw in more classic maps
@itsnerdculture I think the "free to play" system from Nintendos mobile games is totally crap. It's the same like Mario run.
Can you like my recent please and thx? And use #941k we pick people up if they're good enough and use the # 5 times

I've been sweating with this gun on my level 50 moze. Extended mags + every 4 shots is free bullet makes me shoot it like 5 times (tops) before reloading.
@fetus_____muncher pretty good for a 50 moze. I'd say it'll be fun for a level 50 Amara, barely at 40 tho
This gun with a lvl 50 fl4k melts bosses, usually never have to reload on one fade away
@bigsnauzz_66 Level 50 moze with this shotgun shreds bosses with flesh health. God it's so good
@humanbean117 its pretty good can rip anything reload speed is quick on that thing
@fetus_____muncher Guardian rank + skills you can reload that shit in like 0.5 seconds lmao
@humanbean117 I’ve yet to try Moze yet but her skills have me realllllly curious, started fl4k for sniper build, stayed for fade away😂
@bigsnauzz_66 Moze is either about her mech or shields. In the half of the game, she's dependent on her mech. In the endgame, she's fully focused on sacrificing health for shields. With the correct equipment, you can have up to 80k shields. I currently have 42k so she's pretty overpowered. Thing is, you regenerate 1k a second lmao
@bigsnauzz_66 On my time with Fl4k I mainly used raak attack. Pretty awesome if you have that life steal for his raak and Fl4k gets better if you have the guardian rank skill with "when fully shielded, cooldown is faster". I basically became rakkman
@humanbean117 holy crap, try to farm for a deathless artifact if that’s the case, found one for my fl4k but it’s pretty much useless, I got it from the warden at the ancil
@bigsnauzz_66 Yeah I have that one artifact where it takes all health but adds like double shields, it's so good. Haven't played her much recently, been focused on level 40 amara and currently almost done for Zanes storymode.
@humanbean117 heck yeah, good luck! I say this while I start on my Moze 😂
@bigsnauzz_66 I can get you started with a few tips. First off, if you're going into mech mode, jump first then deploy. She deploys faster so you can go into combat better.
@bigsnauzz_66 For the mech itself, I recommend focusing on the green tree. Forget the grenades part and focus on cooldown recharge etc.
@bigsnauzz_66 Endgame if you're lucky enough to find good high tier shield, relic and class mod, respec and use all your points on the red tree and the green tree (my bad, the blue tree was mech).
Anyone got any tips for zane build mayhem 3 having trouble getting a sturdy build together
How do u get it
But can you punch people into red mist?
Does anyone know what the handling stat does? My guess is that it has to do with weapon swap speed?
@professapig.mp4 I run his shield and drone action skills. At first I did the clone but Zane is squishy in general. The barrier tree beefs him up quite a bit, and the drone buffs him hella so when you're in a field of enemies, as long as you can kill just one, you're set.
I will find it one day but know I'll be happy with my handsome jackhammer
Use Zane and get his MAD SPEED and use that and you will be doom guy
Best gun in the game. By far.
I have it on my amara
And lvl 50 too
Right on their head too, nice flick! 😲👍
@rainbowsixjon thanks friend 💪

Ocarina of Time Baby, the game that got me into the Zelda Franchise. 😮so much nostalgia, you know what I’m gonna go play it right now 😂
fucking twilight princess? yikes
Wind waker, nice
The wind waker
Skyward Sword
Waking up in hyrule, but it's majora's mask so your in Termina 😳
No
It’s not even hurtle for me and there’s a fucking moon coming down
April- phantom hourgalss- is actually my first zelda game lol
Breath of the wild
Shouldn't Majoras Mask be in October?
Twilight Princess... My first Zelda game... Kinda yes-ish because of the "realism" and it ruins it for me (I don't like the npcs)
Awesome!
FUCK YEAH MY FAVORITE ONE MAY🤘🏽
I got breath of the wild :o
Extremely happy because I wake up in my favorite game of all franchise, my dear Wind Waker 😄
Phantom hourglass I mean its aight i guess
Skyward sword...
Here comes the moon.....
I got the game I hate and that's Majora's
I only exist in a dream :/
Link to the past so ye
@riceseoks it’s pretty fun, it’s similar play style to phantom hourglass
majora’s mask.... please no
Shit I got phantom hourglass
Ocarinaaaaaaaa
Links awakening
Yay I got my favorite Zelda game, majora's mask
AHWHWHW I GOT LINKS AWAKENING
I got Wind Waker
I got Wind Waker. Gonna be sailing for the rest of my life in peace.

I wish I got windwaker
OOT BABYYYYY

Oh my God I got windwaker. I'm so happy.

Imagine being born in october and waking up in the shrine of resurrection, then being tasked with saving the entire world, that'd be scary as hell. P.S. i got Ocarina of time :)

@_steamsales it
Captain Toad 🍄
Never played nintendo switch sadly but mario kart is always cool and i like crash and spyro from playstation so theese are cool too.
Fire Emblem Three Houses!!
Gotta be Mario Kart still.
Botw for sure! 😊 Sorry Yoshi!
The best game whit best music hotline miami if only they added the level editor from PC
Fire Emblem😍❤️
Fortnite probably the best game
Odyssey!
Legend of Zelda
Fire Emblem!!
@_megan.carrot Same!
Breath of the wild 🤩
Mario Kart 8 💜💜
Astral chain
This is literally 2900 New Zealand dollars 😂
Super smash
Smash of course
Hate to put it over xenoblade but its gotta be smash
Mario Kart 8!
@ok_flex_but_weird you got me xenoblade is life
@thequeeng22 good choice
@mazin_hassan16 good🙌
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and torna!!!
hoooonestly?? this is controversial but. probably 3 houses.
@_megan.carrot interesting 🤗
Super Mario Odyssey 👍
@alexaso 2 votes for odyssey so far 🙌
Mario+Rabbids: Kingdom Battle
Octopath traveler
Wait..Tetris 99 has a physical copy?
Super Mario odyssey
Splatoon 2
Smash
😍 je choisi mmmmm Mario odyssée parce que je considère breath of the wild et Mario kart 8 comme des jeux de WiiU.  MARIO ODYSSEY😍
Smash of course
Botw
SMASH!
@80gamerben really in all that just smash bros 🙌ok
Easy breath of the wild😁😁
Going with what I own it would have to be Odyssey followed by yoshi. Don’t own Zelda yet lol
@ditchdrgamer ok so odyssey first choice got it
@qcluck 🙌 for sure the best zelda in all 2 of them
Smash

En minecraft (ultima version)si le cae un rayo a una champivaca se convierte en champivaca marrón... también con unas tijeras podes podar a las champivacas (rojas o marrones) y quitarle los hongos y transformarlas en vacas
Sabían que si le cae un rayo a un creeped se transforma en uno eléctrico y su potencia explosiva es mucho mayor a la de un creeper normal... también ese creeped si asesina para lo vuela en pedazos a un mob... va a dejar su cabeza
I need this.

@louietangca if you don’t mind me asking, is your major in college web design?
@attic.cat My major is actually Photography and I’m minoring in Business. But before pursuing photography, I was a Chemistry + Pre-Pharm Major.

Might get this for my GameCube but there's another underrated gem on PS2 called Auto Modelista
It's a must have for sure. I like the controller better for racers. I keep Gamecube strictly for exclusive nintendo games. Hmmmm never heard of it, I'll check it out on youtube
@trevormarshall43 Modelista was HUGELY underrated. 💪🏿
I dont even remember hearing you react like that
“i feel like a gAHHWd” 😂
@xewel_ i overhyped this clip by a thousand 😂 it was in the heat of the moment
Jesus. Someone is ready for next season haha
Quit gaming 8 months ago. Bought a new car, I have an amazing new girlfriend.I party every weekend, I'm never home. I'm enjoying life. Do yourself a favor. Stop trying to make gaming a career. It's cringe as fuck
@youngest_meme you’re lucky I don’t have a certain copypasta on my clip board s m h
@youngest_meme you know what hold on
@youngest_meme What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
@whosbenji you sent 3 different messages in a row for 1 comment, really are cringe af

Omg 😱
Wait which pokemon got the first?
Eevee was actually ranked as one of the cutest Pokémon in the world
@loet_goose yes
*gets ready to use thunder* alright who did this
Hey man the fuck all the pokemons r cute and nice in their own way
Mikimyu may not be good looking but u just can't stop loving him😭😭
@arcena_xt Jynx
@theonejolteon the list is votes based

@dicen_silverwing the list is votes based
@aura_king_lucario well I gonna use thunder on those people
Bruh, why the hell am I not seeing wormadam up there
ATTACK!!!
They didn't call pikachu ugly tho
Pretty sure that's what they want. That nonsense just gives them more clicks and internet traffic.
@aura_king_lucario 🍟
Y u comparin a pikachu to a milotic🤣🤣
@harrythewizard16 have you seen some pokemon? Like Jynx and Mr. Mime
probably they never watch Pokemon from the beginning
okay pikachu and eevee are both overrated but i still love them and they are by no means ugly lmao
@concealedmemes.exe yes they did those are fans against it
They called them ugly are you kidding me!!!!
EEVEE IS MY LITTLE FLUFFBALL
@angel_aguado_r @elmelpulgar
Top ten? 😂😂😂
@michielhoeijmans @guusje_tralala we shall kill the bringers of these lies
Top 10 pokemon: pikachu number 14 👏..👏..👏
You mean you are the insult of the pokèmon community because you said Pokémons nobody likes you
@manu_ill still calling pikachu uglu
@manu_ill *ugly
pikachu may be worn out to the point that im sick of seeing it but its still a cute pokemon
Its tru to
@aura_king_lucario $3.99
@calzone_lanier those are people against them
@harrythewizard16 have you seen jynx
@aura_king_lucario oh ok
@aura_king_lucario that's good. they're overrated.
@igacomics true, she sexy
Well the list says top ten but eevee and pikachu aren’t even in the 10th spot,they are above that
I love it how ppl think 14th and 21st count as two of the "Top TEN"??
This is bull wth >:0
Don't they fucking dare.
@wannave_ling_ling i think that's their pokedex number
@matthew.ruzzie.2019 Pikachu is #25 and eevee is #133 😢. I'm guessing it's a cropped edit of some sort but still a nice meme
Top 10 ugliest Pokemon so that means Pikachu is  number 14 and Eevee is 21
@official_doclab they are just out of the list
@aura_king_lucario Top TEN
@wannave_ling_ling yeah 😂😂
@jose._._._._._._ 3.99💵
I AM SORRY WHAT
Who would call my precious eevee ugly?! Seems like i need to kill someone today
I know Pikachu is overrated but come on he is not ugly at all Pikachu is opposite of that
Hi I’m self promoting
These 2 pokemon are for normies 🤷🏻‍♂️
@ryan.montreal but definitely not ugly

Pokéfans unite
All Pokémon are cute
Read the thing, it says they're cute
So according to this, grimer is better
You beat it already? I'm so behind!
Yeah it was such a good experience 😁😁
@poptartambrosia I kinda couldn't put it down...😅😅 It was all I wanted to play and I couldn't get it out of my mind. Lol How do you like it so far?? 😊
@xgalaxyghoul I'm enjoying it. Brings back memories! Splitting time between it & Borderlands.
@poptartambrosia We've seen so much on Borderlands, everyone is loving it! It almost makes me want to play it. 😅
@qcluck I loved how cute it was!! The art style is stunning! The anime in the beginning and end differing from the toy-like art style during gameplay is such a genius idea considering the backstory on the game itself. The cutesy toy-like version of Link is so far my favorite version, but that's probably just cause I love cute stuff. 😅😅
@xgalaxyghoul the art style is great it would be cool if they kept it for a new top down Zelda or maybe for remakes of seasons and ages
@qcluck YESS!! I would play the crap out of both Seasons and Ages. That and Minish Cap are totally due for a remake. That would be so exciting! 😊
@xgalaxyghoul Minish cap👍🏻 that’s a good idea too😁
Nice 👍🏻

لااااااا😭💔، كنت احبة هالشخص، وايد تقديمة ممتاز بالمؤتمرات و خصوصا حركة ان كل مؤتمر يلبس قميص اللعبة اللي بيسون لها ريماستر 😭💔 خسارة والله💔
وهل هذا شيء مؤثر علينا كلاعبين؟
افاااا💔💔
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😭😢
حطو بداله عبد الله السلمان
@_b246 لا ،الا في حاله وحده جلك واحد ملعون صلايب مسك مكانه
@agent_0x وش منكن يضر فينا؟
افاااااا 😑
الله وياه
افا 😭😭 😓
طيب ليه غادر
@majidsh25 ما اعلن السبب
شباب باركولي حطوني بدال شون ليدن رئيس لشركة سوني وابشرو بعلوم الطيب والحصريات
أنشاءالله يكون مكانه واحد أحسن مانبي سوني تروح بداهية
💔
ليه وين رايح !!! 😢
يعني خلاص نهايه شركه سوني 💔🤦‍♂️
لا تنسى andrew house. أهو طلع قبل جم سنة
افضل انه خرج افتكينا من واحد باقي 3
@_b246 هالشخص وايد كان مهتم في الألعاب اللي تركز على القصة. اهو اللي كان يدفع فلوس حق كوجيما عشان لعبتة الجديدة ، و حق نوتي دوق، عشان لاست اوف اس ٢، و سبايدرمان و قاد اوف وور. كان اهم سي عندة دعم منتجين و شركات الالعاب اللي تركز على الالعاب الفردية و طور القصة، اكثر من الأونلاين نفس فورتنايت و غيرها. للاسف كان من افضل الأشخاص و وايد كنت احبة. راح اشتاق لة حيل و خصوصا ظهورة الرائع في المؤتمرات 💔

Niceeeeee!
@thedesigntrip thank you!!!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁
Just restarted for the millionth time, always try to mix it up but end up with a two hand heap on 😂
Finally, a funny skyrim meme
I'll just hit them with my bare hands and when my health goes too low go to my inventory and eat 72 cheese wheels then finish them off like a true Nord
I have a 98 damage ebony Warhammer is that good?
Question: what debuffs am i missing out on as a mage?
Two handed in Skyrim truly is the most boring way to play.
@nxtanthxny i have a 1 billion damage daedric hammer is that good ?
@manuel_mercury um.. Wot?
@nxtanthxny yeah with mods
@manuel_mercury oh
anyone played double swords?
One handed who uses shields:"pff mortals"
@nxtanthxny for vanilla that's good, even for a "immersive" mod playthorugh. But my one hand imperial sword vanilla does 91 damage 😂
@declancornack wasn't there a way to slow enemy's and make them more easy to kill like take more damage
@martes_de_piel it's the way you die most because if you fight someone who has a shield and knows how to block you will get alot of damage but all your attacks are stopped
@dprairsoft873 pretty sure those are shouts, i cant think of any debuff spells except like paralysis but weapons do that more than spells do
@dprairsoft873 yay I'm cool
One handed and shield is the best style

Retail is for the weak
@caseanova_ this is what stupid people say to numb the pain of auto attacks and the slow Tetris like pace.... Bunch of yards
@blackarthasxd it’s what the strong say to the weak
@caseanova_ bro listen... Being stuck at level 40 doesn't make you superior... It actually shows how mediocre you really are. It's crazy how people who play Classic think they're actually better at the game 😂😂 when on live you can't even get out of the first win of LFR
Thank you im totally over this classic superiority complex lol.. its older not better

Last of Us remastered free again?.. I understand PlayStations want to get the hype train rolling for part two. But a free game repeat. Tisk tisk..
@ri.mac
Nigga I just bought Last of Us yesterday
@didyouknowgamingfacts ur so funny
@didyouknowgamingfacts for real tho, I haven’t bought a single game on the store and have about half the size of my steam library of just free games, most of which I have or will play
I can't wait to go home from school and play BOLT THE VIDEOGAME
@mattybalks well I havent gotten it yet, and I've recently heard it's very good so now's my chance
PlayStations just making fun of Xbox now😂
@chriistofffer
@tj1295 nah I’m mad that I just bought it like a month ago, less, and now it’s free like wtf
Def snagging friday the 13th
@youngmrla that's why I'm saying that, even if you have it physically, you never know what could happen to the disc, so saving it digitally could help out in the end. Plus, never hurts to have a digital back up or something, and you won't need to repurchase the game.
@tj1295 nahh bro I see it as me losing out on $60 when I could’ve waited a little
@youngmrla to each there own, but wait you can't sell it back or anything either? To at least get about $40 back or so???
@tj1295 yea I guess that’s what ima have to try and do 🤦🏽‍♂️
@youngmrla if it helps at least it's still high in value where you can get a good chunk of your money back :)
@pedro__garcia
I wanted to buy last of us 1 before i played 2 and i was gonna buy it but im so glad i didnt
Is MLB any good?
@jon.cunn04 finally a man of culture recognising bolt the game as a true masterpiece
@_willy_aranda @cruz.jose10 get em both tomorrow
Fucking last of us for free??????
Sony wins again! Good for them
I’m gonna say this in the kindest way possible.. What the fuck Xbox?
@lukebw04 yeup
Xbox: HERE'S FUCKIN BOLT FOR XBOX 360
@alex_will_oof_you hell yeah
@suchaparagon yeah, really. I liked hitman but thats been it the last few months
@youngmrla physically or digitally???
@tj1295 physically
@youngmrla ah now you can get a digital copy as a back up at least! Lol
@ivan16milan bro Friday the 13th lol😂😂
Motherfucker, I just bought the last of us a month ago
@didyouknowgamingfacts barely they gave us baseball...BASEBALL
@___.__.__sam__.__.___ we got that for free last year tho on PS
@tj1295 fuck that shit
@youngmrla don't like digital or what?
@corecore1500 wtf you guys got LAST OF US FOR FREE FOREVER i got xbox the only good thing is halo n like cyberpunk but it hasnt dropped so xbxo is still gay. You got a steam tho? 👀
@___.__.__sam__.__.___ ok and we get the last of us
last of us fucking wins.
@didyouknowgamingfacts wym we got bolt
Wtfffff mlb 19?? PS4 wind fs fs
@jay_rob1988
I've been waiting for razor's edge to be backwards compatible im excited
I spent 40$ on Friday the 13th when it came out and it was a waste 🤕
Xbox won
L for Xbox 24/7 with those free games lmfao Microsoft really doesnt gaf about yall 😂
PS
@andrewgehring
Hyped up for Ninja Gaiden tbh
@___.__.__sam__.__.___ how the hell?
@big.brain.steve.main yeah I have a Xbox and last of us is better
@big.brain.steve.main Friday the 13 is a really fun game I would play with my friends all the time. The last of us is still pretty good tho
Playstation wins with The Last of Us
@kawaii_papi_666
@villehentman
We are getting past of us tomorrow right?
Ninja gaiden was lit back in the day
PS4 won this time
Playstation gets good games, Xbox gets more games
PlayStation flexing
PlayStation wins this month imo
PlayStation, I want Xbox to actually give us good free games for realll
Damn a couple months ago I bought last of us but I’ve already had mlb the show
Yeah I think Xbox won this one, I mean they got Bolt the game
Epic Games could advertise “Everything is free on the Epic Games Store” and not have it be false advertisement lol
Yoo wtf I just bought mlb 19!? Bitch
Wow
Sony
I have The Last Of Us but I’ve actually wanted to get MLB The Show
Friday the 13th was a good game until the devs raped it on its 1 year anniversary by saying no future content smh. Shame that the little kids got on the game and ruined every lobby you find to
I might have to actually download epic games store for Metro
@didyouknowgamingfacts Xbox never wins for free games with gold🙄 Every month they’re some boring and weird indie games
Also mlb the show is a great game but don’t expect it to have 2K graphics lol
“What took you so long?”
I pick Xbox mainly for Friday the 13th
PS4
This is an awesome way of selling TLOU 2
Quien de las dos es la amiga?

I shit you no i read this a meta sword 😂😂
Are you going to make a lance build?
For anyone wondering the Zorah magdaros is another good LS that’s a contender for the top
@scythesagan probably not soon, I’m working on some Charge Blade sets atm, and thinking about DB/Hunting Horn/SwitchAxe. But maybe. Certainly isn’t last on the list.
@j_shxnks True to an extent, however Zorah is best in specific match ups, this is better in the most matchups, which is why it’s the best generalist. Also the Zorah requires the rarest decos in the game to be viable. It’s also ugly af.
@xenoswarm I dont mind even if it is last as long as there will be one, keep up the good work!
@xenoswarm oh I totally agree for sure, I was just letting your community know and spreading more knowledge❤️ there even in two star poison match ups and 1 Star it wins by a hefty margin
@j_shxnks they’re*
@j_shxnks Well i believe it would only be a top contender if you had good blast proc RNG but if you're talking overall performance people should generally go for Luna instead. But yeah Zorah does pack a punch which is hilarious
@dragoonknight20 that’s just not true based on raw values and blast damage. And it’s not an RNG value it works like all ailments. Making Zorah a stronger option over the Luna ones but it does have included razor sharp on one health regen so a little more flexibility in the sets itself so maybe someone’s gonna need to run some more numbers on em’ but as it stands Zorah is better than most and about tied with GRATH
@j_shxnks Aight bet well said 👏

How did you get that
@byers1157 i just searched it on the App Store
Nice 🔥
I really can’t find it on the App Store, are you using android or iPhone
@a_a_ronmathew I had to search for the call of duty companion app, then go to activision, and click on the COD app
@a_a_ronmathew it's not out till tomorrow anyway
@brandon_jeter18 oh okay cool can’t wait
@brandon_jeter18 it’s on the app store right now 😂
@jagielskey welp nvm then imma go download it right now
@jagielskey yeah sometimes they release it early on some devices. Androids on the other hand will take a few hours to roll out.
@jagielskey what does the app look like because it ain’t showing up
@a_a_ronmathew look up the call of duty companion app. Click on that, and then click on activision as the publisher
@jagielskey oh okay thanks
@jagielskey I downloaded the companion app for no reason then 😂

@xsightstore у тебя забыл спросить куда мне идти 👌
Я каждый раз крою их хорошими словами особенно натуральных арта ярдов
Пидороводы СКА по 40к боёв у некоторых
@wrestling_rus63 и там кайфа мало
@max_mud_ov да
Да пидарасня ебаная артапидарша ненавижу
@ponomarevfil я понимаю, я сам играл , качал, Прем есть колесный, даже название забыл, не смог смириться с этим танком, уж больно они не для рандома, проста читерство перед другими танками
А чего еще с этими СТхами церемонится минусовать их и дело с концом!! Пт рулит!!
Я в вот блитц перешел, арты нет, и плюшки всякие
Арта👍это говорит о том, что арта рулит🤗
А для Вас, еще бы аха танки не ездили и стояли... мальчики, что вы ноете...арта в игре рашит все у вас сопли.... что Вы за мужики? На то это и игра.. и Выражаться нужно культурнее..Уважать играков других.. ухо режет..
О ,бозеее, он пидяллл??
А что ни кто ни ноет чтоб бабаху понерфить? Ни много ли урона за выстрел? На раз сносит
Бывало что она помогала и из-за неё удавалось затащить
Рас в 100 боев есть пробитик
Мне на т 10 несколько раз на фул хп залетало.. это просто пиздец
Нехрен кормой к арте поворачиваться и подставляться
Вы можете не материться. Вас су... Ка дети смотрят
Как раз меня вчера пробила арта на 1400хп ска! Причём на с.коне был
На консольных танках т 92 может и на 2к чемодан прислать 😀
300мм. Брони пробила карта 👏
@aidarkarim_28 чем вам эти колесники так мешают не понятно ) ладно Арта которая играть не даёт,особенно на 10 лвл по кд с 3 артами ,но колеса то что ? Не понимаю хейт в сторону колес ,это уже у вас лично какие то проблемы с ними
Нухуя она дала на 1300🤯
Твою члена😂😂
Ушел в блиц после бб
Я на Е 75 от Т 92 ббшкой в борт ловил на 1700.Бля раз 500 игру удалял
Арта говно и Арта пидоры
Такая же херь бро
Парни а кто во что играет с онлайн. Что посоветуете?
@wrestling_rus63 зря
Да ладно уж прям из-за арты удалить игру😂 это все равно что не играть в онлайн шутеры из-за наличия снайперов 😆 Просто классно играет на арте, молодец) но на арте так могут не многие. Сам как то пробовал играть, очень специфично
@koshman0206 wows
@xsightstore ты сам понял что высрал?! Ни о чем просто
@xsightstore за чо ненавидеть? За то что оно весь бой на базе стоит и по кд тебе дает одну за другой, а ты ничего сделать ей не можешь потому что оно далеко за спинами противников, и дальше кидает тебе пока не заберет. Ты беспомощен против арты, которая "совсем не имба " Скажите спс разработчикам.
Эра танков заканчивается.
430у это?
@tariel.centr не думаю что зря бб просто становится все хуже и хуже раков дахуя баланса нету Арта ебет и много всякого дерьма вообщем можно говорить бесконечно
А сам играет на арте. Сам он говно следовательно
@____aleksandrov____ ну с подобным манером общения идите ка в танчики)
Красивые рисунки
Я же удалил, из ща арт, из за колесников,
Me robaste los post pa mi cuenta :(

I'm hoping that 1% chance that Dina didn't get shot is gonna happen, but if she didn't get shot then clearly something bad is gonna happen to her it's ND
Start crying my friendoo 😢
It’s inevitable
If Dina don't die Joel will die
I hope dina doesn't die because ellie and dina make a great team
@cloudellies not confirmed
@thelastofus2news i would rather want dina to die than joel
@zarakbaloch67 well it makes sense that she did. just what i think
@cloudellies see i dont think naughty dog will give such a huge spoiler for thier most biggest game. Its naughty dog they can bring huge twists
@zarakbaloch67 well i mean who else that she loved dearly would die like that? to me, i think dina isn’t exactly a huge character in part 2 so that’s why. it wouldn’t make sense for joel to have died since he found her while she was killing all the seraphites
Ya Sarah was adorable too.
Uhh. Ya she dies. Obviously what happened
She obviously gonna die or at least won't appear on most of the game due to something happening
@zarakbaloch67 all of us
@cloudellies Neil said that Dina is one of the main characters of the story... she may not stay alive... but they will not kill het that fast... He said she plays a big role in the story!
Either Dina or Joel
@thatguyinurcloset for a second we thought ND meant Nathan Drake, like Ellie would be swinging around a tomb somewhere 😂
There’s an idea that Joel is already dead and Ellie is seeing the ghost of him, like a father figure. What’s your thoughts?
@theplayercode I mean they might use the same style, bruh imagine they somehow do a  crossovers or at least an Easter egg 😂
she was literally shot in the trailer
Just cause it looks like Dina got shot  that doesn’t mean that’s actually what happened
I agree! She cute too, I love her personality (or at least, what we've seen of her)

This is brilliant! 😂
Yeep
Truth
Great sketch 👌❤️❤️
Been on both sides (mostly on Tumblr tho lol). When I like and don't follow, it's usually because I have so many other similar content accounts I'm following. Other times it's because the account posts a few other things I don't like (outweighing the other stuff that I do like).
F
My personal least favorite thing is being followed, then dropped.  It happens frequently to me and leaves me wondering for a brief moment why I keep getting new followers, but my follower count is hovering at about the same number it’s been at for the last month or so.  I’ve also noticed there are some repeat offenders out there.  As in, they do it multiple times to the same people if they haven’t followed yet.
Why u gotta roast me like that smh
I would never!
It h u r t s right here ➡️❤️
You're drawing are good but I feel like this account is more hating on other accounts than anything else
It’s truly painful how much I relate to this 😭
@spark_e_muntz You’re definitely not the only one. I just assume they’re looking for a follow back and are planning on dropping you whether you follow or not. I only get that from meme and spam pages, so it makes sense. Kinda
I can relate! 😩💔
Definitely haha
Hahaha yeah
Ooph
Oof
This is accurate and illehal gaH- 😭😭
Because they spam to be followed instead! lol jk idk....just a wild guess
This is 🔥 🔥 🔥
Ughhhh I hate this with a passion! If I’m going to like someone’s art but not follow them, I at least like just a handful of their art, not the whole gallery lol! Love your work, btw. Keep it up. 👏👏
I relate to this... I spam art accounts but I don't follow😂😂😂
I was referred to these platform by a friend online and I thought is a scam company ...But I was moved to try and here I earned,I just want to share it to you people too.if you doubt click here @stanislav_gulmira_fx now and start making money with your smart phones

Yessssssss scorpion!!!!
@doorsales I only wish they coulda carried the cmd grab over. And maybe KOTH one of these days but I usually don’t feel like it cause school n such
@kombatmultiverse when ever you down I'm down
Basically MKX scorpion in MK11
I’m gonna have so much fun with this variation, finally a reason for me to play him again
i mean misery blades been in since realse, not much skill required if youve been playing since then🤷🏽‍♂️
(This is just a joke don’t take it seriously) If you play Scorpion, congratulations, you’re 80% of the players online
@davis_lock_ I feel my sins crawling down my back
@andresgherrero that’s why I love it 😂
@daviopapii I mean the cancelling pressure and mix up game is a bit more advanced than what most Scorpion are prolly used to playing 😂
@kombatmultiverse oh most definitely
@davis_lock_ nah you’re speaking truth. They’re as gay as they come.
@kombatmultiverse frr most scorpions are light spear spin spear teleport
Scorpion is a monster in the hands of a skilled player.  Also how do you unlock that brutality win pose?
@justin.joestar win pose is random, they added new win poses a few weeks ago. you should get this one half the time and the original one half the time
@sacred_icon I’m still technically a Kotal player so I’m aight
@daviopapii A lot of people mainly play Ranked so using these moves are pretty knew to them
@axelpellegrini I am going to kill myself
GG
wait so did they add new moves or
I actually like you can cancel the misery blade
New variations=new gear 
S T O N K S
@doorsales hell yeah, one of the main reasons I like this variation. That and the jump punch.
@doorsales hell yeah, one of the main reasons I like this variation. That and the jump punch.

It’s a great game, I’ve played since the pre sequel and the games been the best ever since. I love sirens🤧🖤
@somelostavocados I have been playing the siren and I love her skins/heads! I played gunner and like wish she had better stuff lol so ima prob switch back
@gamestergoon siren is so pretty tho🥺
@somelostavocados lol oops that’s what I meant ima switch back to siren bc she looks better lmao I have the cat backwards hate on her rn w the hippie skin I love it 😍
@gamestergoon what lvl are you?
@somelostavocados hmmm idk maybe like 14? Not sure I don’t really play the story or solo I just jump on baes game lol. And I’m barely like 8 on gunner
@gamestergoon I’m 15 or 17 I think but the story takes too long tbh
Someone told me something special happens if you give her 1mil
DOO EEITTT!!! LOL my favourite is Fl4k

Ps Vita ftw
Wow nice! 🔥💖💖👌

@neiltendo_power Any drift issues?
Nice!!! 👌
VITA!
@mlatowski1 not on the Vita 😂
So pretty!
Ps vita for the win
@mlatowski1 none that I’ve noticed so far. We’ll probably need to wait awhile before we know if it’s an issue or not. I saw that some of the initial reports of drift issues with the Lite were manufacturing defects and not a hardware issue 🤷‍♂️

this is the best picture i’ve ever seen
Makes Reshiram Judas
Heat but entei should b there
But isnt darkria evil
where the 3 dogs and 3 birds?
@mitchell.lynch I thought Groudon was in Judas' spot
💙
@spencer.brummett no because in the original Judas (Reshiram) is seen reaching for the same glass as Jesus. It was said that that would be the man to betray Jesus
@spencer.brummett correction its Darkrai in Judas's spot
@mitchell.lynch that makes sense.
💓💓💓💓
Who’s in the middle?
@tame_ultimate arceus
Amazing

Pathfinder did better
pathfinder no cap

@imshrimpi what about apex ‚stealing‘ the battlepass, loading screens, music packs, challenges etc from fortnite?
@twofazze fortnite has stolen so much shit from apex at this point they might as well just stop adding shit to their game because apex will always be better then fortnite
@itsannahale what exactly did fortnite steal from apex? Fortnite was there for over a year before apex came out so what are you talking about dude 😂
@twofazze fortnite stole apexs ping system, their jump tower ideas, two of their skins, bangalore’s rolling thunder, respawn beacons... and like it’s so obvious they copy.. everyone calls them out for it
@itsannahale dude your arguments are pointless because there were ping systems and respawn beacons in other games before apex, so apex is also stealing haha. And fortnite is not in need for stealing content from apex because apex never was and never will be as succsesful as fortnite
@twofazze just like every other game fortnite has copied so many things from different games so your arguments are pointless to

@yr.treece does it still work?  Havent done it ages.
@naiki_boom @rockstargames this is how everyone feels. Take it out of the game!
Me 😂

You can’t remove it from the game because people have already spent like 8m on it
@1cornelius_ yeah haha
🔥pleaae subscripe chanell bigstaroblox link is in bio 🔥🔥 its gamer.ahoj som😀😀 youtuber bigstaroblox daj mi prosim odber na kanal odkaz najdes v profile alebo staci jednoducho napisat do vyhladavaca bigstaroblox dakujem pekne 🔥
When i fly with my bike i only do it for my mission I never killed someone for no reason
And then when you kill him back he goes passive and starts trash talking to you and saying you are trash for killing him
@hamster_boyyyy that is the best part my dude 😉
@demetri_dh_bikes
@hamzahamza010 jij ja amk
This is why I don't play this game anymore lmao
That's what i call a noob action
Thats why i stopped playing gta
This mean war🔥
@u7ez_ noobbike
and that's why you do Public 1 Sessions
It’s not toxic it’s a lifestyle we eat sleep and breathe level 20 doing sells mission
It happened to me yesterday when i was trying to steal some supplies 💔
Ah shit have to call mine as well😂
When they kill you 1 time with that thing, they always focus on you
That’s what you call a pro noob move, all shark cards no skill ,also se lots of players under level 10 fly mk2 oppressors what a shame
@bl4ckstorm yep
@_shepherd_ cause not everyone is a pvp player ok
True
@u7ez_ you're part of the problem.
@u7ez_ Same. I'm in bad sport now 😂😂
@_kostaskasap_
@hr_isaias nor am I griefers and tryhard made me that way I use to be a hard grinder 😔
@9probleem ahahhaha zomaar he in die toros
@matthew_roberts._1 its shit
I dont know why rockstar put it in the Game, its totally broken, it destroyed pvp in gta and then they are making it even stronger.....
@killer_trhiller no barrage rockets
I use an oppressor just for transportation and if someone aims at me and kills me than I get my revenge
@luka_rothe They don't even get money
@matthew_roberts._1 Callate la boca
@luka_rothe That's true
And now you have to kill until they leave
@merlinstanko @lofqvistwilliam
@rosary__ 💀
Noobbike
@teggyace having bountys fell off 🅱️ no one gets them anymore
@cartiinese lol idk what you’re talking about. every lobby I go to at least has about 3-4 bounty’s.
Hey! I Post The Same Picture Of Houses Everyday, Come And Follow My Journey! I've Just Started!
@teggyace every lobby im in i see atleast 2 bountys and its a full lobby btw people killing eachother too and the bountys just chilling
@cartiinese bounty’s are still there in general that’s what I’m saying lol.it’s either the new players that steal cars or butt hurt dudes putting bounty’s on others.
@_sebastianpalacio_ the worst part ie that they removed the auto aim on that damn thing
@brandon_mexicutioner try Bogdan glitch
"Find New Session"
Facts
@_shepherd_ what does that even mean
Good Broomstick counters: Nightshark and Insurgent with Sticky Bombs, Scramjet, Stromberg(if they fly low)
@rosary__ what ever you want it to mean xo😄😄😄
@rosary__ it also means stay the fuck away from me of get clapped lol😂😂😂
@raccoon.noodles I forgot: Fully loaded Ruiner,  a other Broomstick, God Mode Speedo, God Mode Dodo or Sea Breaze(they are so triggerd when I do this), Juggernaut(with BST), shredding them with the Avenger, Up'n'atomiser
@_shepherd_ oh so u one of those
Then congrats you just triggered a tryhard so be ready for what's comin lolz
@rosary__ and the circle gets the square
@_shepherd_ ???????
Thats me 😂😂i kill anyone i see😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love how your all crying 😄😄😄😄😄😄
No different for you crying in game too 😂😂😂😂
@teggyace right
@ford_crazy_2003 gets Hunter lol
@rosary__ 😂😂😂😂 oh dear
Then respond with FL Ruiner
@_sebastianpalacio_ they only thought: Money Money Money!
@matthew_roberts._1 no
@killer_trhiller oh shit my bad i thought you were talking smack my bad g
24/7
@killer_trhiller you can't lol
@unknown.memo3 👏what?
@epicmonkey431 you can. Just fly in cicles. You can dodge evry missles with the Lazer
This always happens to me
@killer_trhiller nvm🤓
@marvelous_god facts, i’m 216 and own 6
@andres_ruvalcaba09 >:c
Idk why rockstar ever thought adding oppressors in the game was a good idea, gta is just not the same because tryhards are constantly killing you for no damn reason.😡
@x_4lyf_x more fun to drive/fly than any other car in the game
@blakeedwards2019 of course man, opp. Mk II wasn't meant to be made :/ mk I is still so cool
@spammingjoey are you a certified bad sport
*starts up fully loaded*
I just killed a guy 1 time on his oppressor mk II with my oppressor mk II me and my 3 other friends probably killed him liked 70 times
@x_4lyf_x im a level 180 and my friends are in the 200-300 range. We all also play on otber accounts which are also in the 100s. The MKII is only used in retaliation against griefers or to defend a shipment. Using it to randomly attack people is just borderline sinful

@blakeedwards2019 💯
not unless if you killed me first or if you got a bounty.
Literally just take that damn thing out the game
@its_angel_maldonado Definitely agree. Me I luckily invested in an R/C Bandito. Everytime they go passive, ghost, or off radar I just hop in my little bitty pride of joy and wait till they're out of it and give them a tiny little explosion to kill them. I also learned how to go passive in the RC so I make tryhards kill themselves thinking I'm not in passive. I'm not a griefer I'm a troll player. If someone goes after me I kill them in the funniest of ways. One of my favorite being suicidal sticky bomb car.
Bruh it's so stupid because I'm flying the Lazar and it stands no chance against them you have to get them when they are off guard
some of these people literally blow me up for my 1k bounty and then kill me 12 times right after for no reason
@_santiago__garcia_
Two words:buy oppressor
FAX😂😂😂
🙊🙊 Awww are you having cry lol 😂 😂 😂 😂
@unknown.memo3 who does that(
@epicmonkey431 wait. How do you dodge rockets with the lazar?
@killer_trhiller me, cause people get mad annoying
And I just don't care until they try it again only to realise Oppressor MK1 is still the boss 😂 Rank 1520 and still haven't bought that shit
Bruh..🤣🤣
@farid__gamboa akula?
@unknown.memo3 ok. R* gives a shit about it
@unknown.memo3 wut. I just sayed the truth. Think about it: why did r* realesed the noobbike? Because they dont care about the game but theybcare about the money.
@farid__gamboa ok. Missles akula?
fear is your first enemy 💀
I just get off
Happens to me EVERYTIME I join a online session on Gta 5
Someone did that yesterday and I just said "ya done? you got it out of your system?" And they stopped. 😂
Report for griefing
That's why I joined a grinding crew all we do is host private lobbies and grind any randoms that join get kicked instantly
2words “ORBITAL CANNON”
@_srto06_ 😂😂
@marvelous_god I am a certified gta 5 online oppresser bully
@its_angel_maldonado I agree, I can't even drive half the cars I own in a public lobby unless I'm passive. The second I get out of passive is the second I get blown up. And then when you go after them they'll just Ewo till they either leave or Orbital Cannon you.
@seba_0899 you on wolf crew bro? 😂
@marvelous_god I’m rank 180 and own none
@spammingjoey bruh
@twistee.the.defiant1 😂👏
@mchammman I can handle myself against griefers on the ground and in a dogfight sometimes with a jet even against the flying bikes but I think it’s stupid that they can go in passive register as a an Mc and call it back for free because I paid for its destruction
why we should have reason to kill when you are a killer it a game  anyway 20k player killed 😂😂😂 you are probably the next
these low levels only own two oppressors 🚫🧢
I swear shit be annoying asl 🤦🏻‍♂️
😂
Wasn’t me
Literally why I stopped playing
And those ones that fail to kill you during CEO work so they get salty and continuously kill you after
Time to pull up the Stromberg, Akula and Terrobyte and start WW3
Then the kid becomes my target till he kick me out the session or he leaves! 😈😈💪🏾

@underfan_henry0103 I got a bullet bill frenzy once. I have never experienced true power until then. So many innocent people died because of me. I may of gotten first that round, BUT AT WHAT COST!!!
@the_ali_cat_o.o :0 yo... I wanna try and get one now and completely destroy the CPUs
@underfan_henry0103 Very well. But be aware. Such power will come at a cost. And yes, there will be blood.
How to say "fuck you" in multiple different languages

Probably the coolest thing to happen to #yegdt
They’ve won a BAFTA?!
@rafpl Knights of the Old Republic was outstanding. One of my favourites games of all-time. BioWare has made most of the games on my all-time top 10 list.
@chrisjhenderson They win everything because they are amazing.
Perks of the job!
Amazing 💕
Sick
🌟❤️🌟 Awesome job and a great game.

Sounds awesome! Ive played it but not with vr 😅
@fieryjuggling I just did a Star Wars game tonight battling with lightsabers alongside Darth Vader. Really crazy experience!
@jugglingelectrons awesome!
This is what we did this morning too! Wouldve been great to run in to each other!
@tdggaming 🤙Agreed. Maybe one day fate with smile on us both. 🙂
Aye it was a fun night, another ship full of look without getting any sand between our toes. Too many kind pirates gathering loot for us!
@cptchrisrow Right?! Chokes me up!😋
I shot her in the face.
And the lady in the saloon that is a total asshole
@hudson_sales1 Never said he would, just making the point he's not only good. And literally his behavior is dictated by the player so he can be whatever the player decides. 👍🏼
I FUCKING LOST 625 DURING A DELIVERY BECAUSE THE “ERROR” u gotta be fucking kidding me
@tyrannosaurus_yang exactly. Mostly speaking about the player rather than Arthur. You were given the choice and I think it says a lot about you if that’s something you chose to do.
@marykoeven_12 Agreed. 👍🏼
@j.avalos98 you good? Jesus 😂
Seems like a thing micah would do
@walkercoleman oh Lillian she's such a bitch 😤
I tackled and slit her throat with my poison knife 😤
@xtoturnwithinx triggered?
Let me vote Let me vote! Let me vote!
I did that once I got shot at
Picture taken seconds before disaster
Y’all some incels lmao mad at an In game woman for wanting the right to vote
@xavi.bee LMAO YOU'RE BIG SIMPIN, it's a fucking game loser.
Anyone wanna hunt on ps4?
@cinnamon.nickk sorry if I hurt your feelings weeb 😂🤷‍♂️
Why are people mad at her?
@tom_tha_badboy04 freak
This was the first video I ever saw about this game since I wasn’t able yo buy it at launch. I knew already that it was gonna be a fun ride😂

If you hit her, you were in the wrong. Game or not, Arthur supports all good, including women’s rights, don’t make him do what he wouldn’t.
@marykoeven_12 Arthur Murdered and Robbed countless people... He definitely doesnt support "all" good. No one is just one thing.
@tyrannosaurus_yang but I don't think he would like to punch an old lady like that
La vida es algo hermoso, pero tengo asumir que aveces la vida tiene que ser protegida con sacrificios y ese es un gran problema ya que ay gente que no se puede proteger bueno chau
@marykoeven_12 Arthur was whatever you wanted him to be. He isn't inherently good or bad. You can go on a killing spree if you wanted. What are you on about? If you finish the game with low honor level it'll be a different ending from a high honor level.
@marykoeven_12 if you hit her you're a man who is fragile and can't understand women rights. I stand with you Mary , most guys who find this funny never had a girl who would give them time of day so they're taking it out on women activisty in video games lol 😂
🤣
Taste this vote 😝
@marykoeven_12 I tied her up, dragged her through a swamp, beat her, set her on fire blew up her face and fed her to gators, what does that make me?
Hey, anyone wanna follow for Follow? Trying to get to 3k🙏
Dislike.

Só saudades! Estou jogando os emuladores nesse exato momento!
Jamais, ❤️ @rayannemt
Por isso que os meus estão guardados k as vezes dá vontade de jogar os games antigos
Atari♥️
Joguei demais o nintendinho.
Se Não fosse os veteranos esses novos de hoje nem iriam existir digam sim aos antigos foram o começo de tudo que vivemos de bom nas nossas infâncias
@viicantuaria JAMAIS!!! São os melhores e insubstituíveis.
@mascotemma  são  insubstituíveis  SIM  verdade  o  q  vc  disse  SONIC  3  de  mega  drive  DONKEY  KONG  2 ,  super  mario word ,  Top  Gear  e  Final  Fight  3  de  SNES ,  alguns  de  SEGA  SATURNO  alguns  de  play  1  como  Street  Fghter  alpha  1  e  o  2 ,  Resident  Evil  2  e  3  que  a  CAPCOM  DEMENTE  e  burra  demais  não  quer  lançar  no  x box  one  e  play  4 😢😝😡 erro  grosseiro  demais  que  fazem  desde  PLAY  2  engraçado  já  que  CODE  VERONICA  do  Dreamcast  lançaram  pro  PLAY  2  tu  acredita ? 😲  EU  não  lembrava  disso  até  mês  de  Julho  2019  quando  comprei  de  novo  um  PLAY  2  o  meu  OUTRO  play  2  não  pegava  quase  nenhum  jogo
@rayannemt  veja  meu  comentário  ACIMA  onde  EU  concordo  com  você  pois  falou  uma  VERDADE  esses  jogos  insubstituíveis  tanto  é  que  EU  citei  alguns // achei  o  RESIDENT  EVIL  code  veronica  do  Dreamcast  pro  PLAY  2  comprei  o  o jogo  ÓBVIO // em  2006  comprei  STREET  FIGHTER  ALPHA  coletânea  pro  play  2  tinha  até  início  de 2014 // desde  2006  tenho  MEGA  MAN  X coletânea  os  3  primeiros  são  de  super Nintendo  e  os  outros  3  de  play  1 // Siphon  Filter ,  Twisted  Metal  etc. // 007  Goldeneye ,  1080° snowboarding ,  MARIO  PARTY e  mario  64  todos  do  NINTENDO  64  etc  etc  podíamos  ficar  o  dia  TODO  falando  e  comentando  JOGOS  inesquecíveis  e  impossível  de  SUBSTITUIR 🙄👏👏 🤗
@carlosfeleti83  FATO  o  q  vc  disse  E  CONTRA  Fatos  não  há  argumentos 😎👍 😏
Atari eu tenho ainda 🙏
Miss Dymlos so much 😂
@_krisnayd Him and Stahn had a great dynamic for working together and getting into fights. [hashtag bffs] -S.
I still dont finish it but is so dman good jajajja
So badly want them to re-release this on ps4. Nice HD remaster would be amazing since we didn't get this in Europe 😁
I just love this game. It was my first Tales Of...so many good memories 😍😍😍
Idk who needs to hear this but please remake this or port this to switch I’ll take either THANKS IN ADVANCE .. carry on citizens 🧐
One of my top 5 of all time easily, love 1 and 2 😍 I also rented it over and over! Super expensive now to buy the disc. Learned the hard way it'll only fully boot on an ps1 or backwards compatible ps2. But not on any ps3, only loads the opening cinematic 😂😭
Proud of RPGFan for this post.  Tales of Destiny is legit old school.  The love for it shows literacy and respect for the classics.  Thank you
I remember my frustrations when I tried to beat the Tower Of Druaga side Quest. If I were not mistaken, it took me 5 retries to finally achieve the highest floor and grab all the treasures. This was done at the time when I did not have internet service at home, not even dial-up internet (ahh, the 90s). So purely finished by trials and errors. The good thing was I became over-leveled for the final stage and the final boss, especially with the bonus skills I learned in the Tower Of Druaga, 😁
this games is another world. should play it again.
Probably one of the most under-covered and underrated RPGs ever
God I loved loved loved this game for PSX. I was in like 5th grade and my mom basically gave me cash for Christmas and went and just plucked this bad boy off the shelf. Ugh nostalgia
👏🏿
I love it
The lawd is my shepherd he know what I want! And thats More Leon, Rutee, Phillia and my man's Stahn! (Switch port please)

@us_jdog wait till you see the second part... 🔥 and of course thank you for all the nice comments!
🔥really love that filter, what do you use to edit your clips??
@squidkid_max surprisingly enough I actually use iMovie on my phone. I upload the clips to Facebook from my switch, then screen record them and bring the videos into iMovie off my camera roll. From there, there are filters that I can use depending on the song and the style of it, it’s actually really fun to make these. And thanks!
Amazing 10/10

@kami_kogami hmm never thought of it that way cause it’s really when he killed the younglings and women
This is the best crossover meme I have seen in months
How tf do you escape
First time I got caught cause I hit the post of the building
@gavin_chamberlain702 you press the jump button when he's close to the gate and he escapes
It’s easier getting caught if you escape you have to run back to valentine to get your horse
@deafsliceofwatermelon 🤣
Get caught im not walking back to valentine because rdr2 literally broke my a button
Got caught
Escaped
Its more fun to escape cause you get to have a peaceful walk back to Valentine as hungover Arthur
i didn't know you could even get caught the first time, i pressed x by reflex and then got the scene and thought it did it by itself but on my 12 play through i ended up not pressing anything and just got caught which i think is funnier and easier
I ran to a pole on this mission 🤣
Escaped it was really easy
@gavin_chamberlain702 Gavin??? Gav? is that you?!

@no_im_not_julian NYCC hopefully
@unfunnymanwithaplan 🗿
It's arkham knight...
@languageofthecomicnerd Knight is still good tho
That’s on PC
I dont understand this had the best fighting and free roaming mechanics out of all the games not to mention incredibly will thought out dlc such as season of infamy and red hood as well as harley quinn it also had the batmobile which yes did get repetative but non the less was a new and fresh aspect. Dont get me wrong its not my favourite arkham game but that does not mean its not a good game for all arkham games are amazing. You guys focus too much on the negatives.
Oooh wormhusk. My OEM counter.

We need a new battlefield 4 remastered with new vehicles and weapons...nobodya wants ww2 battlefeild game like battlefield 1 or 5
@ea.dice
@ea
@hyme_flores battlefield 1 was based around ww1
@morris.eli_03 it still had simlier shit from ww2 as well...if u played the old call of duty game they have simlier vehicles like battlefeild 1 & 5
@hyme_flores the only vehicle in bf 1 that was used in ww2 was the ft-17 French light tank some of the weapons were featured in both world wars yes but they too vastly different time periods
@morris.eli_03 are two*
@morris.eli_03 please remember you're speaking to a man who says feild...... He won't understand that the 2 world wars were different
@hunger_mile this is very true 😂
I’ve been seeing this ad a lot recently and I love it!

Ima be honest it was best souls cuz bonfire astetic for farming bosses and fashion souls
I actually like ds2 tho

Ds1 and 3 are so much better than 2 but you gotta give it to 2, Majula is my favorite hub in the souls series

Lewis Tam vai ser o Bi-han (Sub-Zero/Noob)
Lewis Tan pode ser o Kuai Liang, o segundo Sub-Zero, irmão do Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) que irá se transformar em Noob Saibot.
@psa_souza Acho q vai ter sim, aí só é parte do elenco. Ainda falta alguns personagens principais.

BRUHHH
For me it's finally obtaining and playing a game that i remember seeing in catalogs, game posters or magazines that looked cool but never got because there were bigger games to get on birthdays and Christmas.  These games don't always turn out to be as good as they seemed though. 😅
Eu queria jogar esse jogo
Best part is a lot like what you guys said. Finding games I've never heard of and experiencing something new I would've never thought to try, or trying something I passed when I thought I'd get back to it.
Mark of Kri was so good, I never did play this one though
Ohhh nice! I only ever played the Mark of Kri when I was younger but I remember enjoying it. Have been on the hunt for it for quite a while.
The history of the game
Yup that pretty much nails it! Experiencing games I never knew existed is one of the beast reasons for game collecting. If I were to cherry pick a few titles I would have never played unless I collected I’d have to mention Mole Mania (Gameboy), Parodius (SNES, Gameboy) and Ninja Spirit (PC Engine).

@stephanie_selina have at it
@tupamax_tattoo yo tampoco lo he probado💔
Me lo compre hace poco xd
Por los gráficos y el movimiento diría que sería mejor un remake que un remaster 
Y qué aprovechen para meter el mundo que falto en el original
Justo enantes en la tarde estaba viendo los souls que estaban en la PS Store y me acorde de mis días de Demons en mi Fallecida PS3 :'v
@fasito.de.cebolla estaría bastante bien la verdad
@aelias.xee f por la PS3
@xanderale.jpg @xanderale.jpg Aunque fue el primero que jugué es a mi parecer el más difícil de los souls, lleno de trampas. Y tiene el ambiente más oscuro que los otros. Ojalá le hagan el remasterizado.
@elgamercriollo por lo mismo se podría decir que tiene el sistema más tosco de todos los souls ya que fue el primero y estaban experimentando con el género
@xanderale.jpg yo creo que es más difícil debido a eso más que nada
@xanderale.jpg ahi reside el encanto del 1, no era especialmente dificil, aunque si era tosco y arcaico. Eso le daba dificultad, y junto a la atmosfera, de 10. Si dice que es mas tosco todavia, yo ardo en deseos de jugarlo.
@fasito.de.cebolla Yo igual prefería que se guardarán el ds1 para un remake aunque haya habido que esperar más, en lugar de hacer la porquería de remaster que hicieron
@_victorvyo pero el DS original ya era bastante agradable a la vista por el detalle y los gráficos no eran malos pero con Demon’s es distinto, poco más parece de ps2 y no es tan detallado
@fasito.de.cebolla eso si es cierto, ds es agradable a la vista. Demon ya es otra historia
@_victorvyo es bastante feo e incómoda la interfaz
Pero ya me acostumbre
Huh
@tupamax_tattoo aunque dicen que es tosco al mismo tiempo el gameplay se siente smooth. La dificultad es distinta a los otros Souls y hay una variable muy muy complicada que es el World y Character Tendency. A no parecer es el Souls más sentimental.
Seria genial con esa temática aun mas oscura uno de los mejores juegos a pesar de su tosca jugabilidad.
@the_viking_way_pt my thoughts exactly
@the_viking_way_pt my thoughts exactly
Esa pequeña parte de la vida se llama felicidad
"Un editor de IGN". Ese señor no tiene ni puta idea, son simplemente rumores falsos. "Omitir Demon souls para centrarse en tlou2" Eso no tiene ningun sentido, ya que enseñaron la beta del remastered de medievil. Aparte, todo el state of play fue un indie of play, y tlou2 fue los 3 últimos minutos. Aún que esta claro que queremos un remastered de Demon souls xfa
Cuentas con mejor contenido que el mío @pressstartgamer @insidegamers @gamemondo
Que no nos den falsas esperanzas
Me dejai creisi
Su es real podría valer una fortuna
A mi la verdad me gustaria muchisimo probarlo. Es el unico souls que no he catado.
Me da un orgasmo mortal si sacan el Remastered para PC

It’s one of my faves too and a must-have for anyone with a Switch! 🙌🏽
I love this game so much. Just wish it was alittle longer....I know collecting 999 moons plus side stuff seems like alot but I ran through it too quick...
@alexandra.p0tter Very true, a must own Switch game. I hope we get another Super Mario soon.
@stopduhmerkin I got 999 moons and then ran through it again. You can get through it quick but there's so much quality.
@freeradicaldave there really is, it's all in the detail. The map sizes are so big theres tons to explore. 👌
@stopduhmerkin There was a lot going on, I'll have to start it again soon. I bet I missed lots.
Ohh maybe it’s time to crack the seal on mine!  Yes I'm terrible 😓
@retro_gamer_from_day_0 Definitely, set it free 👌🔥
Nice one bud!
Genesis does what Niten-Don’t !
Awesome, I just wish there was a combo receiver with logo like the old sega one. But you can't have everything.
@devan_vandekerkhove clear blue and slate grey
Someone's bitter Nintendo makes better first party wireless controllers (seriously new snes Wireless controllers are incredible, not that you guys don't do great work)
What is the difference between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth?
Next level 🔥🤩🎮
No way, $46.38 CAD, excluding shipping. That's ridiculous.
i would love some wireless saturn controlers
Does these work with the original consoles or are these only for use with USB ? I might buy some of them :D
Finally!
Yes sega Saturn !!!!!
Nice!!! Getting on for my MegaSg for sure
@veritech1 thanks for the explanation Skull Leader. 😎
@flyinguillotines anytime.. I've been waiting for them from retrobit for quite some time.  Great for the mega sg. And great for the Genesis mini.  Great to have a new sega branded controller that's wireless.
@d3nx.fr 2.4 comes with both USB port and original port dongles.
Will the megadrive version be available with a Japan spec blue button as opposed to the red one?.
@retrobitgaming awesome !
yes!
@veritech1 I have the wired Saturn controllers and I'm very happy with how they turned out.
When’s Dreamcast?
@retrobitgaming will these be available on Amazon?
Hell yeah! 🤘🏻
@retrobitgaming  Are you guys gonna be a Comic-Con this year???
@originalkano yes they will, we will have links up as soon as we can. For now, they are available for pre-order through @castlemaniagames
Yes! Finally!
Next: SNES mini does wireless? 🤔
@kaansgamekorner and ps2 does wireless. I'd definitely buy both 👌😁
Oh damn! Want it! But I guess will wait for Analog Stick version
Hell yeah! I love the wired Saturn controller! I'm definitely getting these!!! You guys are awesome!
Great, now how about SNES?
Does this work with the new sega genisis mini?
Amazing work!👏 Next step...Dreamcast wireless...PLEASE!😀🙏🙏🙏
@flyinguillotines 2.4 much less if any controller lag.
will they work with the mini?
@alejandro_time yes they will
@nick_mann yes it does
Why don’t I see the solid black Saturn controller in 2.4g? It’s in Bluetooth..
I’m just over here patiently waiting for the Dreamcast to go wireless.
omg the wireless  ones are out!! im Getting the Saturn  one!!
😳 NEED

Yep I love MGS4 I have only standard edit but this game is so awesome and instal option in Update is really helpful in this game 😂
@consolegamer_poland yes that update was a lot better than installing between every chapter 😭😭😭
@sgttrapp yeah and watch smoking Snake 😂
That's really cool 🤩 never seen before 😁 and I've only completed 2 for the first time 7 years ago or something but it was really great! After that played maybe half of 3 and 5 😁
Amazing post bro! Big Metal Gear fan. Have played them all. I absolutely loved The Phantom Pain too. I wish he owned the license so we could experience more games. Sadly Konami will never let that happen. Makes me excited for Death Stranding though. 👍🏻
Gorgeous shots buddy! I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan but did play a few of them 😁
This game was superb, I really enjoyed it.
Such a masterpiece of a serie, miss is so much 💚

wow thank you so much ❤️
dang😍
I hear good things about Ecco too and want to try the mini for that game lol
I've always wondered what this game was about...after seeing your screenshots I still have no idea 😂
Def. Stick with it!!!! One of my favorite games of all time. You need to jump really high in the first stage that's when the vortex comes and the game really begins. There's aliens, strange sea creatures, and a dope soundtrack, it's a hard game but so worth it
I’m right there with you I always try it but never stick with it
😂😂😜 sale here..im still stuck con first stage!
I never understood this game at the time of it’s original release, which is why I never rated it.👏👏👏
Amazing. Love this series!
Wow, so amazing!
🙌🙌🙌 So awesome I’m on the hunt for these right now.
Oh nice! I was literally just going through my persona and I’m missing this ones collectors edition and the ps1 copy... they are so expensive now 😭
Such a great port of an awesome game! Love it to bits!
Bom jogo persona
Wooooow great piece 😍
Lol that's so expensive to get now
Persona 🤤🤤🤤
@beverlyhills_gaming good luck!!
@vutang22 oh no!!! Yeah, I dudmt realize how pricey this game had gotten.  Time for another rerelease!
@kekeborky good thing I got it back in the day on clearance at Gamestop.
It was a great edition. I got the same sitting on the shelf. It brings back memories of a time when Collector editions had some real value.
Every day is mail day😁
Great haul!  I can’t get enough of the original Mega Man art.  Ice climber is still a go to for me.  There are a few in that lot I’m still looking for!
@qcluck almost 😂
@inthewildgaming yeah this was an oddball lot but some good stuff! I have never actually played Ice Climber!
I like how this implies they actually use their weapons in the movie. 😜
Dope
👊👊👊👊🍕🍕🍕🍕🐢🐢🐢🐢
I loved this movie as a kid but it’s hard to get through now🤷🏻‍♂️ that’s nostalgia for you.
@mattbearpig86 🤣😂🤣😂

@daddyzilla80 from what I’ve seen is a harder to find game. Goes for about 25 if found. I really liked the Mickey game on the gamecube one of my favorite games even if it’s made for kids lol I’m looking forward to trying this one
Gonna keep an eye out for it. Most of the Mickey games are very well done

@lhaldrich1 I’ll double check. I miss a lot sometimes
@bird_bones_busto it's understandable mam. The one thing I can't wait for the next year is to play the new Medal of Honor in vr. So stocked about its return. Hope they do it right this time.

Looks great! I've started making the Skyrim helmet too, so this is perfect timing to see. Nice paint job on the horns!
@oathbreakerprops thank you! I made this like 2 years ago and I honestly don’t think I could do a lot better nowadays, the cosplay gods were lookin our for lil ol me that day I guess. Can’t wait to see the Skyrim stuff you’ve got goin on :)
@i_make_things_sometimes I'm also planning on a viking axe, so I've been keeping a close eye on your work lately 👍 mine won't be metal though 😅
@oathbreakerprops well have to do a comparison lol, also I /wish/ I could’ve made an actual metal axe, mine was just foam, the only metal thing I did was that little knife
@i_make_things_sometimes oh, my mistake 😅 still looks cool though!

I'm afraid to uninstall it, would it be fine if I did?
It’s gonna be on steam. So is that better?
Wait so I can go from console to PC now ?!
Uninstallled! Still need Battle.net for @playoverwatch but whatever. Take me to that haunted mooooooon!
@andytalamante it’s pointless to keep it on. As long as you migrated your Blizzard account to Steam, you’ll be fine
As much as I'm happy they're out from under Activision. I'm sad WoW, Destiny, Hots, and Hearthstone won't be under the samelauncjef anymore.
Bro I’m so excited!
@espadafive302 yeah

Esse é Loko, to jogando com o domaferas, muito loko, depois vou jogar com a gunner
Bug todo jogo tem poh 🤣
@gael_cpos doma feras é o melhorrr!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
@butaostart cara de primeira eu gostei dele, tem missão pra caramba, é muito frenético mesmo, o legal é que da pra jogar multiplayer na mesma tv.
@gael_cpos sim, nenhum jogo é livre de bugs, mas alguns podem incomodar! Como quando se joga coop a tela da uma travada, e considerando que vc aperta muito o select quando ta jogando... alem da queda de quadros que acontece principalmente no pc, são bugs chatos que não comprometem o game como um todo, mas ainda são chatos!
@gael_cpos é, split screen é raro dms hj em dia!!!
@gael_cpos é ótimo para jogar com os amigos e é até mesmo viciante kkkkkkkkkk
@butaostart super né, deve ser um dos únicos, tirando os jogos do lego.
@gael_cpos de cabeça so me lembro de cod, também tem !!
👏👏👏👏
@gael_cpos pior bug no PC é ser exclusivo da Epic! 😢
@nunesvitor82 a epic que vende ele no PC?
@gael_cpos sim e com  exclusividade de 6 meses deles!
@nunesvitor82 puts que porcaria hein
@gael_cpos uma coisa que eu sempre falo, não até eu seja fã do STEAM, mas é lá que tenho 90% dos meus jogos multiplataforma e onde meus amigos também estão, tenho o PS4 para jogar os exclusivos, os multi são no PC!
@gael_cpos não que* e outra coisa, não curto muita coisa que a Epic faz, nada contra se as pessoas querem comprar lá, casa um faz o que quer e compra onde quiser! 😂👍
I’d flash you any day
This hit a little too close to home 😳

I hate you
When i first came back to siege After not playing for a yr I looked at clash and just found out right before this meme she is a chic not a dude @doctheroamer
WE LOVE YOU CLASH ❤️
@ethan.whs cause clash is annoying to run across constantly
If it was me you would no longer be able to aee my pupil
@jacob_060 *bikini *
@bikinibodhi
Bikini fans
@cameronmiitchell
i can agree
It wouldn’t exisy
@bikinibodhi
@doctheroamer love her to
*white eyes*
@andrew.seay how’s his opinion wrong if he’s talking about his most favourite operator on defence 🤡
@doctheroamer popular answer: because she's easy to play and doesn't require any skill whatsoever
No
@__notcarterrr__ cause she can back away and still hurt people she can run all she wants lmao
Words that Rhyme: Clash is Trash
“Up to” not “at least”
Marley?
@bikinibodhi
@andrew.seay that's why I said unpopular 🤡
Clash best op proof here
@zane.kogos huh m8
Clash is my main 😤 💯
Clash kinda hot doe ngl
@doctheroamer clash is fun to play
I love this shit
@doctheroamer ❤️
@ethan.whs wut
@doctheroamer yesh
@big_aunt_clash no “running In the halls!”
@official_kiwi_hours yes
@seamus_weir
Pupil: dilates -55%
Pupil disappears
Clash is actually an amazing op if you know how to use her correctly. I got a 4K with her last night
Me. She’s such a babe
I agree
the wakandan warrior herself
@trey.c.w So is Tachanka... (literally any op used properly can be amazing) I just hate going up against Clash in 1 vs. 1 situations.
*Awakens rinnegan*
Why do people ban clash, one nobody plays her, two everyone I've seen play her is trash so
When your defending, you love it, when your attacking you hate it.
Unpopular opinion: Clash is actually my favorite defense op
Boi
@dicusbrandon why? she’s best with a team in a 1v1 she has a huge disadvantage just like monti
R u dumb
@doctheroamer well your opinion is wrong 🙃
Awesome, enjoy! 🖤
@thepopinsider I already have the slippers on😂😂😂🖤🖤

Qtip and some alcohol  that should do the job
Spit and violent, i think i wanna punch this guy in the face😁😁
LOL!!!!!!
The true OG crew remember the original Nintendo cartridges and trying to jam them in the front of those old school Nintendo’s.
Actually says not to do that right on the back of cartridge, “Do not blow on edge connection“ but no one ever listens. Shit I was 25 years old when I found that out lmao shit worked for me 😂
Eu ja ensinei pro meu filho as frustraçoes de nao conseuir ligar o game e ficar assoprando tudo, kkkkk..
@carlos_villamizar clasico😎
@jmendo25
The harmonica 😍
@isk8njallday also dont lick your switch carts 🤣
@uncle_josh_games 😂 👍
I think it wasn’t plugged in
😂 it’s life) n64 cartridge axax, cd ps1 very hard)
He's game is not on there's no red light
Why a 64 cartridge tho? 😂😂😂 maybe an NES front loader, but not no damn N64 lol
Better alternative than blowing the cartridge or alcohol/qtip method.. Hydrogen peroxide! 100% every time 👍 thank me later. Found out by accident. Helps clear away the corrosion
@manuel_villamizar 😄😄😄
Ugh, I hate when people think this ACTUALLY did anything. 😂😂😂
Yes omg😂😂
Not that hard
Dumbass blowing moisture into the game
@mauricio_miranda.1123 this is it bro 😂
🙋‍♂️
The struggle is real
@fecampoz
My life lol
I swear especially James Bond goldeneye
🤣
😂🤣🤣
NES was the worst 🤦🏿‍♂️
Which game was he trying to play lol
How about pushing the cart in at a certain angle or a certain amount - that works for the old NES front loader I have.
Q tips and alcohol gang
bruh my dumbass used water once. still worked tho
Hahaha and when it finally goes on 🙌📣👏🏻🥂👍🏻😁
Mf was putting more spit than air into it... on top of that he slamming that shit 😂
Never had that problem past the NES
I notice either way his console not turning on 😂
Me trying to play zombie ate my neighbors on sega genesis
Haha, I always went straight for the rubbing alcohol and q-tips! No sense in getting lightheaded from blowing unless that was the goal!
Pretty sure this was the first thing I learned how to do when I was 4 and started playing NES cartridges
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The struggle is real back in those days😂
@fancy_dog_gaming bro this is gonna be you when you get your N64 🤣🤣
Get lightheaded just tryna get one damn game to work lol

Misma calificación le doy al Zelda... Dragon Quest ya podrías calificarlo?
@dynn5 yo había jugado DQ el año pasado cuando salió en PC, aunque no lo terminé pero le tenía 60hrs invertidas. La versión de Switch tiene DEMASIADAS mejoras y una de ellas es la música que la hicieron orquestada, cosa que no pasó en pc o ps4 que sonaba como sintetizada 😰. Y el hecho de jugar en 3d y 2d a la vez en el switch. Y los gráficos no se quedan atrás, obviamente un poco menos potente que pc pero nada que envidiar. Se nota que no fue un simple port, Square Enix le metió bastantita mano a la versión de Switch 😍
Por que 9 de 10 el zelda?
@neiljo89 por qué el framerate jodiendo por ratos, no me gustó mucho lo del dungeon maker aunque estuvo algo bueno. Y lo principal, que siempre el dungeon final del jefe me pareció mal diseñado xD pero bueno ya eso es algo que venía así pero pues pensé mejorarían esa partecita.
@cees_09 esta bien, esta bien, concuerdo contigo uwu
It's never too late to join the fun 😊 just checked some gameplay and it looks awesome 😍 they need to make a Saturn mini so I can enjoy some of these games 🤦‍♂️
@bl85gamer It's a solid game for sure! Paying attention to and attacking the two different layers of enemies keeps things nice and spicy 🌶 I'd definitely get down on some Saturn mini action too!
I have the Japanese version of this game called Layer Section and this game is freaking fantastic. You chose well 👍🏻🔥
It’s one of the better Saturn shooters and that’s saying something. And the Saturn version is the best version 🤘
Better late than never. Glad to have your post and thanks for the tag. The week is technically over but I want to post your video to my Story later anyway 😁
@turbothunder16 Thanks, I appreciate it! 🍻

مافي فايده بس خمس مئة حبه منه و طارو في عشر ثواني و ينزل شهر ثمانية السنة القادمه
@nawaf_n89 افا. انا قريت في موقع IGN انه يمكن يعاد تصنيعه
اول مانزل طار وكلمتهم قالوا احتمال يكون فيه دفعه مو اكيد لانه ليميتد اديشن ٥٠٠ حبه بالعالم وطارت في اقل من نص ساعه .. جميل
@gamers_break هي والله ياخي لازم تطلع دفعة ثانية. انا بعد سمعت انه ممكن تطلع دفعه ثانيه. اذا ما كان في ترى الكولكتر بعد مجسمه حلو

Beautiful
Nice setting! And for me I'm not sure which Dearly Beloved I love. It's either 2 or BBS.
Adorable!😄
😍
Ur kari is so cute
@shan.nyan thank you 😚
@jannik_settinger 😎
@mroshawott_ryan hehe
@shadow_foxes BBS IS SO GOOD 😭
@jonathon737 TY!
@lulexiaa literally has one of the best piano solos.
Ahhh...too cute...😭
😍 Kawaii lol
Kh3 dearly beloved!
@kiwamisymphony that reminds me of Rogue Legacy, not nearly as punishing but a clever little rogue like that used generations and birth effects for randomness
@theimpureking I played a lot@of Metroid on the Gameboy lol
@mariee_antoinette_ gameboy, fucking hell that takes me back lol
@theimpureking Hahaha doesn’t it!
@theimpureking I always wanted to try that one! It looked so charming!
Whenever Super Mario Bros. go old school side scrolling/platform style, I’m all in!
I haven’t played many 2D side scrolling games, but Ori and the Blind Forest and Celeste are my go-to games if I need something to play for that.
@radical_808 ah one of the OGs! Nice pick. I remember Mario 3 blew my god damn mind as a kid
@kingcommander0 oh man the fact you played Ori is instant respect. Love it more than most games of any kind tbh
Castlevania was probably my fav lol
@digitalvibe117 symphony of the night I’ll assume?
@theimpureking think it was 4 might have been called super castlevania actually
@digitalvibe117 the one on the N64?
@theimpureking  pretty sure i played it on SNES.
Castlevania
@kingsyzed a classic series! And I’m so glad Bloodstained was made, since Konami doesn’t care about games anymore
Castlevania games are my babies.
@mo0nlite same, especially the Iga ones! I’m hoping Konami will one day do a collection of those (but doubt)
@theimpureking Symphony of the Night will forever be my favorite!
@mo0nlite same! And that’s why I’m so glad he got to make Bloodstained, we all deserved another true Vania
I adore 2D style games! I grew up on MegaMan X and Castlevania! My personal favorite by far though remains Hollow Knight. Its stylish, fun, and vast!
Oh damn I remember shovel knight 😂🔥🔥
@kiwamisymphony dude I feel that. MMX is such a badass series. And god do I love Vania. I still need to try Hollow Knight and Dead Cells though
@mark_ice03 yeah she’s hot lol and shovel knight was epic! Xbox version was best as you got to face the Battletoads 😎
She's hot
Wowe
Me on my period be like
@moggiespawn I thought you’d feel her dark style
@moggiespawn yeppp
@moggiespawn LOL. Well that made me nearly choke on a chocolate covered pretzel. Gg 👏
@theimpureking is it a flipz
@moggiespawn nah, homemade
Shaolin Monks Mortal Kombat lol
@silent_anubis wait, wasn’t that one isometric and not 2D? Or am I thinking of the wrong spin off?
@theimpureking both those game series pretty much made my musical taste today and I still love them both dearly! I highly recommend both! Although Dead Cells is a roguelike with some pretty harsh difficulty compared to Hollow Knight over all. Not counting the INSANE Hollow Knight DLC that's all free 😂
One that comes to mind is Metroid
@mariee_antoinette_ classic! And I actually preferred her in 2D, although her 3d games worked too
🔥🔥🔥
Damn! This is a really awesome shot! 🔥
@van_der_linde_gang thanks man
That's how I would make a Dark souls guide.
Try tongue but hole!
I’m sorry all I see is a berserk reference

Sounds like something from the Adams? 😂
I have the wiggler from the set on the left and I’ve been wanting the bowser jr so I’m super excited. Those wind ups seem pretty neat too
$4.99 each
My strategy is gonna be to feel the bags before I buy them. That way I can guarantee I get bowser jr
Definitely will try to hunt online for peach and bowser jr since there aren’t any GameStops here
@maxthememe524 same, the only one I really need in the set is jr. I have wiggler already and I don’t really care for Mario and peach that much. I may get them, but not sure yet
@lemmy_toys yeah peach,Mario,and wiggler are cool but something about the bowser jr just seems really cool.
I want the wiggler and bowser jr
Nice! Can't wait to get my hands on those Mario toys. I bought some of the yoshi windups before but I still don't have eve u color

I think it’s probably better to post more current pics. It might attract new fans. Plus once the game gets released I’m sure your page will blow up 😊
@twd___tlou Whatever I do I lose followers. 😬 My page is shit, I don't know why I'm still around.
@elliesjokebook I love your page! Tbh The only reason I’m still on my account is because I talk to friends and I still follow fan accounts.
@twd___tlou I appreciate it. Kind of feels like nobody else cares about me being around still. 😅 That's good. I try to talk to people, yet nobody seems to care.
Don't let the amount of people following you, or liking your pictures say what self worth you have. It doesn't mean that you or your content isn't any good.
Do the stuff for you and because you like it.
@joshua_flipping_washington 💯
@joshua_flipping_washington Eh, I've lost motivation as nobody gives a shit about me on here. 😄
@elliesjokebook Hon, you should definitely only do it for your enjoyment. I love what you post, no matter what. Nobody cares about my bs shots, but I post them because I enjoy taking the time to actually capture them.
Spoilers
But still do what ever you want
Lo tienes digital ?

I just bought this game yesterday, still playing the story mode
Today I was relaxing and doing more shiny hunting! I might finish let’s go finally lol 💖
I finished putting up new curtains in my gaming room. Just couple more pieces of furniture to pain and it will be ready. Busy weeks ahead so might not be for anytime soon - but at least it’s getting there! Love this picture 🌸 Bravely Default games are so much fun! Looking forward to the toy pictures!!
@beautigamer relaxing days are the besssttt~ I’ve been a little sick all day so I haven’t had the chance to rest that much 😭 But yay shiny hunting! And Let’s Go! Which version do you have?
@witchlagombi ooo I can’t wait to see what your gaming room looks like!! I need to take time to redo my room too~ But I’m glad your day was productive! And I love the Bravely games too, I’m sad they’re backlogged in my list though (and sadly I don’t even own Bravely Default, I just have the case because of my work haha). I want to get it soon tho!
Happy Monday to you Cherry!! ❤️❤️💖✨ Enjoy your break and relax! ✨✨ I hope you manage to take some photos you like too! Today is a pretty relaxed day for me, just appreciating the time I have off before school starts 😭😭
These are two of the best games on the Nintendo 3DS! Monday was a great start ☺ I hope you enjoy your days off and get everything done that you want to 🤓
enjoy your two days off! hopefully you can relax and enjoy them to the fullest~i am working today and will play some ffxiv tonight ^^
Love this shot! 😍💕 It’s already Tuesday so I’m planning to drop my brother at the train station and then work, and I also would like to take toy/book/game photos 🙈💕💕 have a lovely day sweetie!! 💕🌸💕

PES le mete mas a los rostros que a la calidad del juego
Los gráficos en las capturas se ven así, pero en las celebraciones o el juego como tal, se ve diferente jaja
Si los gráficos están chidos lástima q PES sea un juego tan miserable 👎👎👎 y ahora ya ni la champions tienen  así q para q gastar ?🤢🤢🤢
@2000stronger
Ya se pero da un poco de miedo
Pero la verdad les hace falta mucho no me gusta los movimientos de los jugadores yo prefiero la fifa que se junte la empresa ahí si estaría chingon como dijera el buen Chicharito imaginemonos cosas chingona 😁
Esta mejor fifa
😂😂😂😂 FIFA es FIFA
Los gráficos son buenos pero los movimientos de los jugadores es una basura.....muy poco real
Se parece más de cerca que de lejos 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Wow @lagambetasports tienes razón
@diego1128glo al igual que los uniformes, de ven muy falsos
Necesitamos un juego más con más ➕ avilidades en el juego y con menos anuncio y que tampoco tengas que comprar jugadores con plata efectivo con tu tarjeta de crédito así que seas más ➕ especiales a la hora de hacer el juego y verán como el juego tendrá el mayor éxito
👏
mi opinión me gusta más el fifa pero si les quedo muy real la neta
@super_ra_6 😂
@2000stronger 🤔
@super_ra_6 se ve igual 😂
Por que los argentinos tiene  las orejas como duendes jajaj😂
Parece kratos 😂😂
✌🏻
Pero solo los gráficos😢😢😢
naaaa ...no importa ta mejor el @easportsfifa 😁
Se ve muy caricaturesco saludos gambeta ❤️
Lo único que falta es que los jugadores jueguen en la vida real 😂😂😂😂
el mejor juego el Fifa sin duda ...
wow genial se ve cool
Pero sí ya salió el PES2020 y no es así la cara de Messi
Se parece mas en fifa 20
Los gráficos de PES en general son basura la verdad pero bueno
What do we gotta do to get a mix of old maple and new 🤔 I’d love to get back into the game and revive it
Mad Empress 🤣❤️🔥 @maplestory
My face when I boom from 12 to 13
How much is that figurine?
@lol_jk_ily 😂😂😂
@daxterbeergms it's a statue, not s figurine
She looks like she's really pissed. Not mad pissed, but bored pissed.
It's giant
Instagram crashes whenever I see maplestory on my TL
My face when maplestory disconnects me after putting in my PIN
I want this in figure form
Maplestory deserves more players like for real...
Funko pops should do some Maplstory figurines!
@bromar_e i know XD.  I like being silly.
@pekisa_42 it used to have many more players, where you been?
@beirera glad i'm not the only one 😄

@mbmeadow Same! So many memories from this game growing up.
Pura mrd ese juego
Lo unico que hay son flaites, niños de 10 años gritando, pay 2 win y flammers ah y tambien "trolls"
Nah, me sobran como 7 gb y en realidad el free fire ódienme quien me quiera odiar pero es un juego bastante pobre de muchas cosas como jugabilidad, gráficos, calidad de juego, experiencia de juego, originalidad, etc

I've been dying to come across chip music albums on GB carts!
I want to have those things so bad
@toptierdeer look up 8bit music power. Also @asmretro made some.
@ext4nt_official it’s a bad addiction, I want but can’t afford most of em
@grazcore maybe it's a bad addiction, but I would say that all those things are worth buying
@ext4nt_official I want the world to have more of these in existence so the only way they will keep going is if I support, at least that’s what I keep telling myself :p
1-bit symphony 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
@puppy_tooth ✌🏻
I loved that 8bit power music release !!!
Would like to see some more live chiptune with your Korg volca
@subterror I actually got one track almost done with it I should really put out.

Really nice pic! I'm also a Gamer. :)
I mean the Lucio nerfs are probs gonna stop this kinda stuff anyway
@shayg52 that speed reduction is only when he’s attached to the wall which no reddit lucios do anyways 😋
@xwichitax yussss give it a crack 🔥🔥
@ellendetr thank you! Do you play OW?
@thexboxlucio 💯
Savage rollout 💯💯
@thexboxlucio i never played it before but maybe i'm gonna try it now 😄
@geezyclaps let’s go 🔥
@thexboxlucio oh so normies who stay on the wall get affected k
#luciovibes
Time to go flank some zenyattas 🔥
Did you change your button layout? @thexboxlucio
@wolffangz_ 🔥
@zac301 yusss
@leif._.feo nah i just have an elite controller 👏🔥
@shayg52 pretty much haha
Is this really a roll out? I mean the actual definition of a roll out is character abilities interacting with the map in ways in which it shouldn’t eg, doom flying when he hits roof tops. But this is a neat fast way to get around however amp was not required because if you were contesting you may want to save amp for the fight
@henrylight15 i believe it’s a rollout as it’s a quick way to the point using a characters abilities. This was just a custom game to show you guys the route 😁 Amp is normally saved for the fight

@luizf.araujo tamanho, é mais barato, é só portátil, não dá pra pôr na tv
Tá parecido com kratos
Tá legal esse switch lite
O dinheiro que vou gastar com os jogos novos do PS4 não me deixam comprar um Switch kkkkkkk
Pague 3 leve 1 nitendo como sempre explorando o povo brasileiro , porisso nunca passará do 3° lugar
É impressão minha ou é menor
Opa Sidão. Eu gostaria de saber se você poderia gravar um vídeo sobre as vantagens e desvantagens de ter um Xbox? Obrigado
O switch lite conecta no siwtch normal pra usar como controle?
E como funciona a divisão de jogos de mídia digital?
Li "Games Hunter" e já veio a continuação automática em minha mente "links na descrição". Kkk
Sorteia um!!!👏😂😍
Qual vc prefere sidão o lite ou o normal?
Estou apaixonada por você... switch lite 💚
@namichelini iiiiih
Bonito demais pra eu ter um me falta uma coisa... A grana

Nice find,  I need to add it to my collection
Awesome pickup I’ve been having my eye on this game as well but it always so expensive lol
Nice bro. Collecting these Pokemon games are getting harder. They are hard to find and the prices on some are more then when they first came out.
@brainless_gonzo I know especially the gameboy advance versions
@nintendoplaystation lol I know I just pulled the plug $26 and I had a 5 dollar coupon lol
@ninjagamer1990 nice bro wonder if it’s cheaper where you live at
More Pokémon is always a good day 👌🏽 haha
@xeneriith lol true indeed my friend 🙌🏼🙌🏼
@retro_games_pops I started collecting the handhends a few months ago. So I definitely know what ur talking about
@brainless_gonzo I have all the og gameboy ones and for the gameboy color I’m only missing a CIB crystal version but man that’s a lot of money but I will get it next year
@retro_games_pops I just wanted one of every hand held. Then I seen all the purple ones so I want to get a few more of the GBA and maybe get a GBL even though it wasn't sold in the US. Maybe I'll find it cheap in Japan when I move there in Jan 😉
@brainless_gonzo nice 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Need to pick this one up sometime
Amazing work I can only get to last 10 in duos 😂😂
Link up I’ll get you right @skullgaming101

Is that a good series to read? I love the game and can't wait for T.V series. Love reading fantasy novels Drizzit and Forgotten Realms are some of my favorites
@solomuck I highly recommend these two books here! (short story collections) The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. They basically cover everything you need to know and supposedly what the Netflix show will be adapting. It also makes playing the game again a refreshing experience! The novels are great too, but very heavy in politics and king stuff haha
Thanks for the advice I will check them out.
Lmaooo
@chagaun_sonyeo silver my nigga this is bronze
@taina.kathleen an?
@owplayes YOU DID THIS TO ME YESTERDAY😂😂😂
@im_timthetatman is this you again? 😂
@overwatchplanet_ hehe I had to 😛
@owplayes 😋😂
Either this is a noob D.VA or freaked out when got the nano. Ana WTF why nano D.VA 🤣🤣
@narzalean_the_odd_halforc Might not have been on purpose 🤷🏻‍♀️
@uma_rockeira que? kkkkkkk
😄😄😄😄😄
I DID THE SAME THING ON THE SAME MAP EARLIER
Ultimg while youre nano boosted this guy bronze XD
@francis.cua imagine not eating pizza while watching d.va nanoed
😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💔👌
Oh hog 😂😂
nice that d.va wasted a good nano. they woulda wasted the d.va ult too if they weren't lucky
Was that a hog hook ?
Done this once as roadhog
@chagaun_sonyeo damn this dude takes ow more than a game
When you just waste a nano
@serendipitouswolf  imagine hooking a nanoed diva bomb 🤡
Roadhogs am i right?
Is there sound?
OMG IM CRYING HAHAHA
@narzalean_the_odd_halforc no you.
@al_jabrisaeed finally someone asking the real questions.
Task failed successfully
@angrytank_killa its the truth. There is 0 benefit from it
@narzalean_the_odd_halforc what’s the benefit of your existence, Hmm?! Nah but I mean if it works it works, maybe they just like to waste ults.
@angrytank_killa mines to suffer 😂
@chagaun_sonyeo seems like your the problem most of the time bud
@angrytank_killa and it doesnt. They removed the nano efrect from the bomb a long time ago.
Lol. thanks raodhog 🤣🤣🤣
Ana mains died inside during this clip
tf is this dpi
Nice hook btw
BAHAHAHH
Enemies in Bronze be like
@0kty__ is it fun when your Ana throws nano into you when the fight hasn't started? Is it fun when you nano someone and they throw their mech away? Is it fun when your Dva just lets her nuke sit still for 0 kills? Is it fun when your Hog throws?
@chagaun_sonyeo your malding bro
@chagaun_sonyeo who hurt you
@zhuqued teammates like these
@chagaun_sonyeo it's a game, relax bud
Nerfing after Ana uses her ult on her 🤦
poor Roadhog 🤣🤣🤣
@xxdads.gonexx mistakes happen mate.
0
I've trolled my team in comp doing this. Hooking dva ult into us giving her a team kill 😂
I have genuinely teared up multiple times forgetting about my boosters and ulting
@jakalate bruh
WHY WOULD YOU ULT WHILE NANOED
@chagaun_sonyeo who dropped you when you were an infant
Bruh
the hog should get the assist on the killfeed
EXAXTLY WHAT THE ROADHOG DID 😂😂
The part I hate about this is that the Nano’d Dva ult’d, wasting the nano
Everything in this video is wrong but i like it
@francis.cua imagine dva bombing while nanoed 🧐
Also MelodyNoon
@chagaun_sonyeo she’s not looking at the window
@donut_flame she looks directly to the right side of the window of the restaurant building opposite choke.
@xxdads.gonexx found the bronce player
@l.duff00 diamond player you mean
As a roadhog main its nice to help others sometimes
HAHAHAHAHAHA @djosh best hog outcheaa
Reasons why I play Sym when my friends play Dva, I TP their bomb cause I have a sense of they might mess up
@pacific_rose
@xxdads.gonexx You think she didnt know lmao.
@saintekay obviously she didn’t, I’ve never popped ult before using boosters if that’s what I was trying to do, it’s not that hard lmao
@xxdads.gonexx It’s probably less than 1% of times that I fuck it up lol
@chagaun_sonyeo who cares what rank ??
@chagaun_sonyeo ok jayne calm down
@volimte.shanty I care this is an awful play by everyone 😂
@ndarubhramastra I'm taking that as a compliment
@chagaun_sonyeo you need to relax........ it's not that deep man.
@0kty__ it really, really is.
@cjdawliest Looks like a QP match, so makes sense
@chagaun_sonyeo I mean not everybody plays the game competitively, some just play for fun lol
@snow_keaton my thoughts exactly, why i never nano a dva with ult ready or a mcree, though with mcree it can sort of work
happy accidents
😂😂😂😂
That wasted nano though 😂
Ashe should’ve gotten the assist
Imagine nanoing a dva bomb 🤡
@jotarosmarlboros Haven't played comp in a long time, but I ranked gold last time I did and you see this shit happen ALL the time. Either it's a dva throwing a bomb with nano, or you nano a teammate who has been spamming that their ult is ready during a push and they don't even use it.
Why👏would👏you👏ult👏when👏nanoed
@doubledriptwohard because all of these clips are silver/gold qp clips
Nano d.va bomb. Thats such a waste.
I played with a roadhog who did that to his team it was hilarious and it got me play of the game #couldntHavedoneitwithouthim
WTF roadhog 😂😂😂😂
When you dva bomb after being nanoed
@riley_thomas01 that’s what I’m thinking
@l.duff00 could this be the long searched level 0 English speaker?
@kendramatics well it’s not that easy to do, just stop getting over excited and use your hot when your boosters have started rather than trying to immediately pop ult when you use your boosters
@chagaun_sonyeo the angle is pretty fine
@donut_flame she was looking at the top window across from choke. Assuming she doesn't fuck it up and launch it into that window somehow, it would land in an easy spot to dodge just by ducking around the corner
I love the design of your account. If that makes any sense❤️
I feel this, and waste of a nano
Nanoin dva momb and hog pulling bomb. Could this be the long searched bronce match?
I sat here trying to turn this up even thought it had no audio and then I swiped down to a LOUD ass post. Thank you OmnicPost
why would you ult even though you were nano boosted
I have the same potg
Lmao, that Roadhog was probably also trolling his team 😂
i got hooked while ulting once and i got a 4k instead of probably 2
Wtf......
🤣🤣🤣
@ereyeager I thought Hanzo jumped on it
@doubledriptwohard sometimes the Ana player will just randomly nano someone so maybe the dva was just gonna ult anyways and the Ana didn’t call out who she was going to nano or could’ve accidentally nano the dva
@favourin if u watch, u can see the dva pause before trying to ult, so she knew she was nanoed and still decided to use her bomb. It’s not like she didn’t know. If it happened at the same time then i would understand but there’s a pause after she got nanoed and before she ulted
@snow_keaton gold players
@pottfest
😂🤣 They had one job 🤣
Whenever I accidentally pop her ult before using her boosters I feel like a disgrace to my team, the Overwatch community, the entire ea-
wasted nano :|
You can tell that this is a fucking gold or below game. Honestly, with ult usage this poor, it's silver. The Ana nanos a full health Dva before the enemy team engages, she gets nanoed and instantly hits q as if knowing she can't aim well enough to get kills, instead of aiming her ults she just sets it still and even if she didn't hit shift it still wasn't aimed right, and then the Hog hook
How?
@carson_yep The roadhog must’ve hooked it
Can’t relate I threw my dva bomb last night and rein pinned it :))) I wanted to cry because I would’ve got a 6 man
😄 Took me a second to figure out what happened! 😄
@fitzy.73 her ult got hooked into the enemy team by the enemy roadhog
What happened
@luis_gabriel_92
@gyan_015 oooof lmao 😂😂
We all know he did it for the meme
Oml it was about to say she just wasted the nano
Roadhog : YOINK!
Why did she ult the d.va in the first place
screw 2 ults btw
Lmao
@ereyeager he must feel like an idiot after that
Woof
But why throw d’va bomb after getting a nano? I never understood why people did this :/
What? 🤯
i got hooked while ulting once and i got a 4k instead of probably 2
😮
😂😅how
bruh
..what... Happened?
pepega hog pepega hog pepega hog
why would you ult even though you were nano boosted

Ahah I still wont know how to play the fucking thing.
I had that.
Fuck yeah i had this one!when toys were cool💥🔥😍
This was the best freaking handheld. I always wanted one but never had one. Always used my friends.
This just brought back a bunch of forgotten memories. I had the top gun version too!
I got that for Christmas when I was young
I had one but dropped it down the loo!!😂
Still do! Bayou Billy 👍

I had one, until I got frustrated as a kid and tossed it against the wall. That water portion was hard when you’re 5.
I just bought that one and part 2 on Ebay. I never had it growing up, but people had it in school
🙋‍♂️
Wow. Completely forgot about these until now. It was such a pain in the ass.
Had that and the sequel game
I did
Me too! These games were hard AF!
@jrakow1185 let's find out 😝
Just got rid of it a few years ago😭
I almost bought this one on eBay but I wanted to find a sealed one without the coupon hiding the great art.
Didn’t have it but wanted it lol!
Totally played this all the time!

@asianstolemychopsticks Last time I left off, I was fighting the Chaos Witch spider demon lady, and sorta left her on read so I'm kinda worried I'm a) gonna be trash again and b) she's gonna be extra explosive ;~;
@pandormancer you were too attracted to her last time. Now you've grown and only feel mildly attracted
@asianstolemychopsticks fair point but she's still really hot...like puking lava levels of hot...
@pandormancer than show her your hotter. The panda army shows no fear *insert panda angery face here*
@asianstolemychopsticks *see pic #2/2 on this post*
@pandormancer same
Do you play any VR?
@menagereofficial I don’t have any on my pc yet. Just my ps4. But might be coming soon.
Well the Oculus rift is really good and plays beatsaber really well. Otherwise, you should get stardew valley! Or the cycle on the epic store!
@menagereofficial I love beat saber and I’m way excited to try it on my PC. The PlayStation version is fun but not as cool ha

We could not agree or have said it any better ourselves. The best thing about podcasting is everybody we’ve come to know and become friends with. The community genuinely cares and wants everybody to succeed, where do you find that in most industries? You don’t.

I am so glad to know you lovely ladies I am so glad for all of the people we’ve connected to through you and other podcasts and can’t wait to see where the next year takes us. ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Ai que bom pq eu não gostava de ter que ficar limitado aos cacos ora fazer as faquinhas
@gui17_ofc  ja vai aguardando  seu dinheiro kkkk
Jogo sensacional gostei demais do primeiro, só detestei de fazerem a Ellie sapatão 🤢nessa continuação, essa lacração é uma merda e fora do limite, forssação de barra total na minha opinião.
As faquinhas caseiras eram bem uteis, mas limitavam muito, ou vc abre aa portas ou vc mata os clickers e cia, os dois fica dificil kkkkkkk
Vai faz falta 😢

@t0xicphillipp2000 wie er rennt! Megaaa 😱
@juststayhumble_1 I heard they will be adding the Spinosaurus.
“That’s too fast....” “something’s off”
@_.itsyahomeboy._ There will be a growth system. This was not initially planned however it was achieved via Stretch Goals! Additionally, there will be a currency/point system, these will be earned through quests and other things. (TBD) This should allow you to essentially "upgrade" your dino.
Wow Kentro is quick
It’s a kentro
@kawan_mr @pedroduarteh
so beautiful SO BEAUTIFUL
That... Is surprisingly fast... Hopefully it doesn't stab itself w/ its own tail
Kentrosaurus?
Amazing!
@giantortora miragaaaaaaia

Ironically I just beat the official English version today 👍🏻
@flamesof24 What a coincidence!  I love that sorta stuff, happened to me once for Super Metroid and it's release day...For a brief moment, I felt like a bounty hunter. ♫ -S.
Ok so: real talk: did the Trials release address bugs? I remember reading something about Kevin's defense being really oddly coded.

Jawolloooo~ Hab selber 6 Werkzeugkisten voll mit sowohl perlerbeads, als auch hamabeads und geier seit paar Jahren mir die hama mini beads in allen Farben zu bestellen, hab aber keine Möglichkeit weil hama anscheinend nicht mehr mittels online banking, sondern nur mehr paypal und cc bezahlen lässt :( (hab beides nicht und will niemanden meiner family oder friends drum bitten zu bestellen)
@katistrohfee Ok mit Enter sendet man hier ab, ich bin so ein insta-Hugo und lern heut lauter neue Dinge, haha 😅 Finde die Motive, die du dir ausgesucht hast zu legen, voll super, großes großes MAG DAS~ ✨
Will die auch machen ;-;
@http_page_not_found404 Was hindert dich daran :-}? Macht echt Spaß, ist total entspannend und das Ergebnis ist immer schön.
@katistrohfee Dankedanke <3 ich hab meine Hama-Perlen teils bei Amazon gekauft und teils bei einem Spielzeugladen (BR Spielwaren, glaub das ist ne Kette). Bei BR waren die echt billiger als im Internet, und außerdem kriegt man da Treuepunkte und dadurch Rabatt xD hat sich immer sehr gelohnt, die da zu kaufen. Aber ansonsten halt Amazon!
@ragrunzel Ah du sagst ja mini beads - ok sorry, mit denen hab ich noch gar keine Erfahrungen gemacht. Aber die dürften praktisch für so riesengroße Sprites sein... Wünsch dir Glück, dass du sie noch irgendwo erwerben kannst!
@ragrunzel ich habe die Perlen nicht, kein Bügeleisen und keine Vorlagen ;-;
@http_page_not_found404 Lässt sich doch alles erwerben! Ich kauf jetzt ein Eisen für 17Eur, und meine Perlen selbst hab ich mir auch alle so naaach und nach immer mal gekauft xD man kann ja erst mal mir zweifarbigen Sprites der so anfangen, um ein Gefühl dafür zu kriegen. Meine Vorlagen sind einfach nur Sprites aus Spielen, die man ja im Internet findet. Einmal hab ich auch ein Digimon direkt aus meinem Digivice nachgebaut, weil ich dazu keine Bilder fand :-}
@ragrunzel hast du keine Schablonen oder so? Alles freihändig gemacht?🙀
@http_page_not_found404 Vom Bildschirm abgeguckt halt :-} das geht ja gerade bei Sprites sehr gut!
Der Tingle!! 🎈😍
@nisl0n Tingle ist so bezaubernd 💕

@andysouthernirl Yeah man! 🤙🏾
That’s one of the nicer ones I’ve seen. This game is so under appreciated IMO. It’s a great game, with great artwork, and harder to find hangtab than Ikari Warriors.
@minus_worlds - To be honest I don’t think it’s even that close in rarity to Ikari.
@minus_worlds - Also no “Ikari Burst” on this one.
@minus_worlds what’s a Ikari burst?
@minus_worlds that’s right I forgot to mention the no burst / burst on the snk ht’s 😊
@dkaps82 - Second Print (also HT) and later has a yellow “From the creators of Ikari Warriors” in a yellow bubble in the upper right part of the artwork.
Very minty!!
@briancollects thanks man !!
One of the prettiest box art games in the NES library.  Not my favorite, but very close.  Love the orange 🧡🧡🧡
@minus_worlds I’ve seen a sealed copy of the no burst somewhere 🤔
@jedisam2013 - Oh did you make a visit to your safety deposit box? Prick...
@minus_worlds just take a Zantac and relax 🙈
@minus_worlds lol
@jedisam2013 lol
@the1uppedcollection thanks am !!! I agree this box art is definitely top three for me 😊
Damn, had no idea this one had 2 HT prints, great to know!
@getthegreggames yea Athena and Imari warriors have burst variants second print Athena would have from the makers of ikari warriors at the top right second print ikari has two player game In a yellow burst bottom right , a lot the 3rd party ht’s had micro variants like this and that what makes them so rare and Imo the rarest out of all the ht games for nes 😊
@retroninja_collectibles ikari not imari lol

Who the fuck is cutting onions I wanna know goddamnit
Least favourite: Super Circuit because the controls don’t work as smoothly, The characters are exactly the same from Kart 64, and the tracks aren’t that memorable. Overall there’s way better Mario Kart Games out there

Favorite: Mario Kart Wii because of the nostalgia factors, The multiplayer is so addicting (especially when you’re falling off Rainbow Road), A lot of memorable courses, and has the best character selection in a Mario Kart game. What other Mario Kart game can you play as Dry Bones, Rosalina, King Boo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bowser and my boy Funky Kong?
Wii is too tier
Top*
Favorite: 8 Deluxe
Mario kart wii is always going to be my favorite. You don’t understand how much time and dedication I put into that game. When I first got it I was trash and cried every day not being able to be good enough to unlock dry bowser. Took me forever until I finally did it months later. During that time I also learned how to do time trails for the first time so I got funky, baby Luigi, and that cool sprinter car u get by beating 24 fast ghosts! Soon I became pro and started making new files unlocking characters repeatedly. Those days.... 👊
Mario Kart 8
Mario Kart tour
8 or Wii are my favorite, super is garbo
Wii is the og 🔥
Double dash hands down no questions asked
DS
#mariokartdoubledash & #mariokartds
64
Favorite is probably 8 least favorite is probably Super
Wii - 7 - 8DX
My favorites are Mario Kart Double Dash, 8, and Wii. Least favorite is Super Mario Kart
You forgot Mario Kart VR and Mario Kart Arcade. Oh yea and Mario Kart Tour. Other than that I like all of them.
Double dash... duh
Most Fav: Mario Kart 8 and 7
8dx is the best, and FUCK DOUBLE DASH
8, DS and Double Dash are the best ones. Really can’t decide which one is my absolute favourite though
I agree with the caption
Wii and 8 Deluxe are my favs
Wii, 7 and DS are my favs
DS and Double Dash
DS will always be my favorite. Wii is a close 2nd though
8 is my favourite, super circuit is my least favourite
Mario kart 7 is so slept on
Double dash baby, og Mario kart sucks ass
Wii gets less credit than it deserves I mean it introduced bikes to the series for the first time and that alone changed everything. Plus you can do freaking wheelies and any game you can do wheelies in I'm all in on it 😏! And it's the one I have the most Nostalgia for because I played it a lot as a kid, content-wise goes I think Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is probably the best one though
Double Dash is my fav, 7 is my least fav
Double dash!
64
Mario Kart 64 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Double dash is my favourite tbh
Double Dash is the most original one
Double dash is best
Wii is my favorite cuz I got so much memories playing with my homies
Double dash is best
mobile gamers are all triggered tbh
I got this from @elixirsoup

For how much did you get your copy? 😀
@jaunzim finca pal
@sega_master_system £15 in 2006 from another collector on sega8bit forum.
I love this one 💙
Sua colecao e muitoo fera,parabens
In brazil this title worth about £ 100 too!!
It's fun, despite being simpler, this is better than the one for the MD that is almost impossible to be played due to the extremely low FPS..The graphics are pretty decent tho..Both are reasonable rare and nice pieces for collectors!

Am i good?🥺♥️
@_mneale of course until i have every steel i want 😁🔥 pretty good! Already 150h 🔥 i want to open a steel museum 😂 would you visit? 🤣
Little bit of ME Andromeda and Fallout Shelter. Didn't had time to play much cause was visiting my hometown ☺️
Zelda more zelda and then zelda some more 😂
@ekuangemi aww that sounds really nice ☺ how is Andromeda? I've only heard bad things 🤔
@ncelica_ that's not a bad thing! I'm also jealous 😂
@_mneale it's so good!
@_mneale Link's Awakening is so good 🖤 I haven't played I Am Setsuna either yet, it's in my ever growing back log 😅
@_mneale Me too. I have finished main story and now doing sidequests. Every time I'm playing it I just can't stop wondering why a lot of ppl dislike it. The game is beautiful. Good story. Movement and shooting is fine. Maybe it has so many patches and now it is good. Not sure. But I do enjoy this game ☺️
@ekuangemi well that's great! I'm glad you are enjoying it ☺ I need to play them all
@sixxinski_gaming I know the pain of that 😂
@_mneale I can't play them all cause so many new games are coomiingggg 😂
@_mneale I'm a sucker for the sale on the eShop, I love buying physical games but when I see something that's been on my watch list for ages go to like £5 I have to buy it. And then I spend ages browsing the sale looking at the 89p games and buying them on a whim 😅 I have no self control haha.
Ive been playing Super Mario World 1 and 2 on the Snes app on Switch. 😎
@_mneale the entrance is free 😂😂🔥
I played Chrono Trigger🤗 Need to start Lost Sphear too 😊
I did only play Zelda links awakening this weekend 😉
I need to be done with all the games I’m currently playing before doom eternal arrives 😂! Also thanks for including me in your post 😍
A little bit of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.
Code vein, Ys VIII and Luigi's Mansion!
Pretty uneventful weekend, didn't get the chance to play anything 😕
Control and Fortnite 🙌
Monster Hunter World Iceborne 🔥 and if i not play i surf on ebay 😎😏
I played lots of Wolfenstein 2 and Link's Awakening. I really want to try Lost Sphere, I love JRPG'S so it should be right up my street.
@lealeaa83 what's Control like? It looks pretty good 🤓
@devilwarrior009 looking for more steelies? 😉 How are you enjoying Iceborne?
@sixxinski_gaming I really need to get Links Awakening! Did you ever play I Am Setsuna?
@_mneale I’m really enjoying it! Enjoying the fighting and there’s a few jumps in there 🙈 but bearable. I’d recommend!
@lealeaa83 it's definitely on my list!
Nice 🔥🔥🔥
🔥
Your gameplay is 🔥 I just put up a clip of me 1v6 in cyberware.  Mind checking it out and letting me know your thoughts?
Noice!

Great video 🔥🎮💯
هل gta 6 رح تكون ع سوني 4 ؟
بدري وانا احسبهم من 2015 حولها
@i7_grey يكفي رديد مافي احد يلعب عشان الاونلاين ونادر تلقى
ماكو شي اسمه اشاعات وبهالتفاصيل الدقيقة.. هذا تسويق معناه "ترقبوا" .. اني كثير لاحظت شركات وانتبهت لهالشي لذلك عرفت ان نسبة الاشاعات اللي تطلع كذب هي 0.1% .
مثلك
مراح تشوفونها الا على نهايت PS5
@i7_grey آها 🌚
يا رجال روكستار كل يومين واحد طالع وقايل بولي ٢ وقراند وكل يوم إشاعة وبعدها يطلع ويقول كذب ما ندري وش الوضع  هو أكيد يطورون لعبة بس وش هي  ما لنا إلا ننتظر ونشوف
فيه إشاعة قبل كم يوم البطل حق اللعبة إنثى كل شوي إشاعة
@loiy____99 اجل انشاء الله اشتريها لحفيدي ونلعب معه
@i7_grey 😑😑😑😑😐
نتمنى تكوون حقيقة❤️
احس مستحيل يبدون بلعبة زي قراند من ٢٠١٨ ويخلصونها لك بسنة ولا سنتين ، اكيد ع الاقل بادين فيها من ٢٠١٤
الحين ريد ديد اشتغلوا عليها كل استديوهات روكستار، بس قراند روكستار نورث بس ؟
@i7_grey منفوخه بس شغلها من تحت لتحت م تطبل لنفسها تصدمك تخيلك انت تطبل لا شعورياً
@otaku_ipo في حرام عليك
Ohh shit.. here we go again
حتى لو تطورت وصارت ذهبية اقل شي اقل شي بتنزل2021لانهم صرحو انهم ماراح ينزلون قراند وترامب رئيس
اووو اوووب طلعت الريحة 😍
@zi9w في بس قليل
@zn.gf4 الجيل القادم 👍🏼
@i7_grey اقول رح اطقع في دقيق بالله اطفال الاونلاين ذول مشكله
يا رجل حتى لو إشاعة والله ما شيء مو غريب على روكستار انه يكون في اللعبة
@taker92 مو*
@imustplay ما اتفق معك للاسف الكل معطيها فوق حجمها شنو عطتنا اصلاً قراند؟اللي نص اللاعبين اذا موكلهم يلعبونه عشان اونلاين؟؟طيب القصة طيب الساوند تراك للاسف الحين اي لعبة تطلع منهم اذا كانت مو عنوان جديد راح تنجح غصب وانا متأكد انهم يدرون انهم اذا جابوا عنوان جديد راح يفشلون
تعبنا من الاشاعات 😫💔
أهم شي لازم تكون في اللغة عربيه 😍😢
بتنزل على سوني٤ ولا
اتوقع ثلاث سنوات وتنزل
@i7_grey ماعطتنا شي ابد بس عرفتنا على العاب العالم المفتوح اللي تقدر تسوي فيه اي شي وكثير شركات صارت تسوي هذي الالعاب بعد نجاح قراند الجزء الثالث، هذا لحاله بتاريخ شركات ثانية، غير جودة العابها هذي سالفة ثانية
ياخي قراند يختفي سنين ويجي بسنه يمصخر الالعاب ميدنايت كلوب اتمناها والله
@hhjhjhhjh مستحيل
والله روكستار العابها فخمة بعد ريد ديد وقراند صرت اثق ب اي لعبة من عندهم 😍
شركة صرحت اصلا انه ما راح تنزل الجزء جديد من سلسلة الا بعد ما ينزل ترامب من رأسه
لو بس يضيفون سيارات حقيقيه ولا بنحول بي سي 😩
@i7_grey  قصدك الي ما يهمهم غير الأونلاين ؟ شدخلهم الحين
شفت اشاعه انه فيه شخص مشهور مكسيكي واتوقع حق مخدرات شي نسيت بالضبط وشو بس عمره كبير شوي او احتمال يكون شخصيه جانبية احتمال يكون البروتاغينيست الشخصيه يعني الاسايه للعبه او شخصيه ظهرت ب 4 اخر اللعبه صدم فيه لويس ومعاه ديمند طاح ممه واخذ هالرجال الي هو اصلا فقير ومشرد وصار غني وفيه ايضا اشاعه احتمال تكون شخصيه وحده رجال ووحده حرمة للان مافيه شي اكيد طبعا. لازم روكستار تصرح طبعا
وفيه اشاعه قديمه بس رجعوا لها بعد احتمال مدينه باليابان او زي كذا واحتمال فايس سيتي وجزء من ليبرتي او فايس سيتي وسان فيرو وجزء ثاني نسيت اسمه
@saud_falarfaj1. اتمنى تكون بفايس صراحة
حلو لكن متى بتنزل هنا السؤال
@zn.gf4 اذا ترامب خرج من الرئاسة لانهم قالو ما نقدر ننزل اللعبة ما دام ترامب موجود
من الشركات المنفوخة اعلاميًا روكستار
@i7_grey اكثر شركة ما اخذت حقها باللي ساهمت فيه بمجال الالعاب

Nunca entendi pq os nomes trocados!!!🤦‍♂️
@trainer.fontoura Nós também não entendemos muito bem, Daniel. Há quem diga que foi pra evitar problemas legais com o lutador Mike Tyson quando o game chegou aos EUA. Outros dizem que a @capcomusa achou Vega um nome sem graça pra um chefão final e então resolveram mudar pra M. Bison. As histórias são várias!

@endro.s34n 🐐⚡️💛
@janodicentra too true.
sigue estando desbalanceado un nigro de mierda
WOW 7 YEARS Later!!! NOW BALANCE PVP and WVW please!!
@joshcoopa seriously, GW1 was a great game. What we need is skills that are unbound by weapon types. We need more creativity to our builds. ESO handles it well for their class building.
So Guild Wars 1 is leaking into GW2 again. Finally.
😮
I LEGIT JUST FLIPPED OUT SO HARD MY HEADPHONES FLEW OFF INTO A PIECE OF CHEESECAKE
@ethereal.blaze it realesd on 2012 so it 8 year old💔😂
Missing anything else from GW1?
@s_q8yyy I forget its THAT old 😂so scrap your plans and announce 3 @arenanet
I see some are locked. Do we have to buy the rest of the templates in the gemstore?
🔥🔥🔥
It's a pitty that you have to purchase more slots with gems. 🤔 The "new" feature is amazing.. but it's a essential part of MMoRPGs in my opinion. 😂
@queenlily916 still its not enough for the time it took to prepare this. 2 slot gets me only 2 wvw build.
@callthebanners it’s probably a little late in the game for that, sadly.
🙌🏽🔥
About 7years too late. Might be back just because of it
Hell yesssssssss @arenanet  we expecting this for so many yearssss!!!
OMG THANK YOU! 😍😍😍
True it would be unfair just to reset everyone but it may bring life back into the game, i miss playing it so much
FINALLY
@frydrandy you know you can do all that in the lobby before you even join a pvp match
@pharaoh.edwards gotta see the teamcomp b4 I decide what build my dude
When will we get it???
What about the old gw?
Yeay after years after years afyer years.. Finally
Finally¡
Few years late
Nice
This is what i need for
@t_u_02 they literally said that pvp will have its own template released later on....
@frydrandy they wont be for pvp cause technical difficultys 😁
PRAISE BE
Nice👏👏👏😍😍💕💕
took you 7 years to do this 👏
It took 7 years to change it...less gem store more in game change!
@fatounetx finally omg
This is a nice first patch, very cool 👍wait... The game is 5 years old and just now getting this QoL? 😂 What next, free permanent harvesting tools?
Yoi needed 7 years, but you finally did it @arenanet
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏
hey guys! it's thief'f traits!
@summers._.dylan yes it is...
Finally!!!!
@catstolethecrown fresh start for everyone like WoW did with classic
@sam47z make a new character? I went back earlier this year and loved every minute... then I got GWAMM.
@catstolethecrown i just think all thw fun mini games in it are dead though, would make them some good money bringing it back out again
@sam47z I mean I agree that it's dead, but it never left, so they can't bring it back if it's already out. How would they do that? just remind people it exists?
😠😡😡😡😡😡
🙌🏼genial, ya era hora de incorporar este cambio
finally!
Finally
I'm happy,  and ty, but dang took long enough.
Finally💀
The more you make it like GW1, the happier the community will get ❤️
Oh this is gonna make the pre match panic in pvp so much less stressful. Bless.
YES
Nice job ANet!
Finally...!!!! 💕
Bring back guild wars 1 like blizzard did
@arenanet 💖💖💖
Really not feeling the "3 free, buy more in the gems store", shouldnt we at least have 9? 1 for each class (i mean the ones you can store and such) each character having 3 is cool and all, pvp pve wvw, but what if im a mostly pve player? Do i only have 1 build template to work with? Or can i recicle the pvp and wvw ones that i dont use?
F I n a l l y 🖤
@t_u_02 You would think..
Finally!!!!
Thank you Dwayna, finally
At Last!!!!!😍🙌
Super excited to check this out! It's something people have been looking forward to for a long time!
SHINYYYY!!
Oooh that is rad, thank you!
YESSSSS!!!!!
Yassssssss finalllyyyyyy I’m so happy thank youuuuu 💖💖💖💖
Finally 🇧🇷
Link ? Where it is
@theran_1_ is it not three per character?
YESSSSSS
Exquisite 💙
@sam47z but you can still play GW1....
LEARN WHAT NOW
ahh yes finally 👍
Yessss finally 😁🔥
April fools in October?
Thank you for this 💛
Ya era hora xd gran cambio! Sigan así <3
👏👏👏👏👏
FINALLY
EXCUSE ME FOR REAL??????? you guys,,, man I love u,,,,,,,
Yeeeees That is what i need since release of Guild Wars 2
Why only 2 free tho make sense to have 3 free. 1 for each specilization and game mode (pvp, wvw, pve)
About 7 years late on this one.🤔
😱

Pretty cool
All of the GameCube ones
I love them all 🙌🏼✨🎮❤️ but nothing beats the N64 ones in my opinion 😊
The best ones are the N64 ones 🙂
Your page rocks🎮🤤❤️
N64: 1; GameCube: 4; Wii: 8
@teerazzler good to know! Thanks!
@theevilyeti thanks!
I haven't played them all but the Switch one I've played the most! 😊 ❤️💛
Mario party for N64 will always hold a special place in my heart 😇

@ednerz I miss you! How are you and the hubby? Please let’s see each other soon. @thenayway too!
@amazingetchman well...I'm a lesbian and not married so the hubby is doing great 😂 it has been a while though! I've been doing good. Just busy with school. It's be great to meet up sometime though!
@ednerz Oh my apologies. I get confused about a lot outside the magic screen! I am glad school is going well! Your pencil work is pretty stunning! Did I ever tell you that your logo turned out awesome. Would love to meet up!
@amazingetchman it's all good. Thanks! It's all older stuff. I'm going to have to post newer work soon 😀 I'm sure we could all make some sort of etch a Sketch meet up some time 🤩

Seguramente ya estés dormida... pero por si no te ayudo... en que mes bebe menos agua una jirafa?? Febrero o marzo??
Que creo que me he enamorado.
@kuraudiu por lo que he entendido has intentado explicar algo absurdo y sin sentido así que tampoco me interesa
Si lo bonito de la vida es que tiene final,por que celebramos cuando alguien nace? Y porqué nos da pena cuando algo termina si normalmente indica que algo nuevo comenzará? En 6h me toca ir a trabajar y no me consigo dormir🙃
@_paracetamor No??? Y no va siendo hora ya? Todos necesitamos unas vacaciones!!! 😉
He comido macarrones carbonara, y sabes que voy a cenar? Macarrones carbonara, soy una mierda
Acabo de llegar al curro y nada, se espera una noche tranquila. Espero que sea así y que duermas bien patito 😘
No es tu cumpleaños pero vaya globos
No sé me ocurre más nada que decirte que sos muy linda :/
Duermase mi niña, duermaseme ya. ... dice la canción

@ang3lou_u 🤭
@_paracetamor 🙄 absurdo o no es un realidad. Hay un millon de posers que buscan atencion. Que te interese o no el tema ya es cosa tuya. Tu eres la que ha dicho que lee hasta que te duermes y yo soy el que se esta aburriendo en el curro porque no hay nada que hacer😂😂
@_paracetamor mis dieces, entendí más en 4 palabras tuyas que en 200 del tonto ese
Tengo que leer un libro de 300 paginas para mañana, que hago?

@kamel3642
😍👀😍👀❤️❤️❤️
Yo no entiendo a las chicas y mira que tengo 23 tacos y estoy casado. Y cuando me refiero que no entiendo a las mujeres me refiero a las que son monas, guapas y tienen ya de por si la atencion de 20salidos, otros 40 perroflautas y otros 80 pagafantas por no hablar delos babosos de internet que miran las fotos y solo saben babear. Para que tanta atencion si ya tienen la de todos? Es un complejo y la necesitan toda, necesitan sentirse importante o es que quieren demostrar algo? No digo que asi sean todas las repipi que son mas plastico que carne, alguna maja que realmente se aburra y quiera perder el tiempo por las redes sociales atrayendo un poco de atencionsin exagerar habra..pero no seran muchas. Me explico?😅
No se quien eres... pero aun siges despierta? Jajajaja 😂😂😂😜
Muy Bella.

Mi crush no me quiere :(

@uagateway let me know when the club starts and I'll come back to protect my spot as the best smash bros player at UAG
@laughing_web will do, Jeremiah! 😂
Honestly, I have no idea 🤔 I don’t know who that is 😅
I just started playing this today lol
I wouldn't mind this
Corrin echo fighter
you mean cloud #2?
@devon_alonzo How? 😂
@kazma8ttv It’s a Nintendo original mobile game I highly recommend 👌🏼
@ssgxnintendo I’ll take a look then 😂
@acemythic_smash It’s a great game I’m sure you’ll find it fun, also add me as a friend! Lol
@hlc_723 I feel he would play a lot different from Corrin especially if Sakurai tries to make him accurate to the game where he can become a whole dragon for a set amount of time
@ssgxnintendo idk I'm blind and I saw blonde boy.
Astral chain, damon x machina...dmthey deserve love too
@sirgeidragu Astral Chain protagonists are in my top 3 picks for the next newcomer, I was really hoping Daemon x Machina but then Nintendo put out just spirits :/ there’s still hope tho! 🙏🏼
I don't know who this character is, but he looks like he would fit in Smash Bros! 😄

i doubt they’d make a MvC2 cab cuz it’d be harder to run Naomi than CPS games. a rerelease would be neat, but i already have Naomi and Dreamcast emulators because of Demul.
Really need to have a mvc collection for all mondern consoles
I am!!
Or at least one with Marvel vs capcom 1, Marvel Super Heros vs Street Fighter, X-men vs Street Fighter
I wanna know how come the TMNT cabinet was released but no announcement.
I doubt they will but would be greasy n would make a killing if they did
I’d buy it ASAP
Wish they shipped them to Australia

If I get this on pc are we gaming?
So are they getting rid of Kings Canyon? Or adding this new map as a secondary option?
Dm us @fys.ggs You have so much Potential! 🐐 Grind for us and use #fysclan for Recognition!❤️🔥🤘🏽
@king.slime.donnie I already have it downloaded on PC 🤙
@king_kolbe.ttv downloading it now
@morganz4 I think Kings Canyon will still be an option, but I'm not positive
@fys.ggs yuck
@king_kolbe.ttv I read that it's going away..but really not sure. I saw it in a post from someone. Not sure if that was real or not. But post did say it may come back.

That was a lot of fun despite the chaos!  Pretty sure @producerbtw is pulling his hair out right now! 😂
@sanitycrypto we are all fired for sure but I think we won the fans over. Lmao
WTH even happened 😂
Is the joker hard? I have smash and I want to get better at it but I have no idea who to main
@supremepenguinow I wouldn’t say he’s hard to pick up, but it takes a good amount of time to learn how to use him and his kit to its best potential.
He’s definitely a fun character to play since he has a lot of good combos you can learn
@strangerous.exe yeah he’s a fun character but it’s hard to approach with him so unless you wanna spend a lot of time learning the ins and outs of every character I advise against picking him up
@strangerous.exe sorry wrong @
@strangerous.exe who do recommend I main?
Nice arsene up b dum dum this is why you’re balding
@supremepenguinow no right or wrong answer just play the characters and see which one you find fit whether it’s a heavy like DK or someone who can combo like Mario
@redeyedrago12 LMAO I didn’t expect Arsene to come out. I was hoping to grapple hook combo
@strangerous.exe LMAO I KNOW BUT ITS STILL FUNNY TO SEE
@supremepenguinow you can try out whoever interests you whether because you like the character or moveset. It’s difficult to pick one character to try out at first when there’s 70+ characters
chrom aint got shit lol
@kitsune_master thats Ike tho
I used to do those up bs all the time , I'd do a drag down and whiff my grapple and get punished, and I'd miss the drag down and do arsene up b. glad to see I'm not alone lol
Did an elite smash Ike fail to punish a standing still joker🤡 bruh your playing against 1 millions i stg

Please stop with the "Yeah but I wasnt even born in 1985 comments"... These posts are for Instagram users browsing hashtags that have absolutely no Financial Education. They need to see a Historical Example to understand how long term stock investing works.. Im trying to awaken 50+ new minds each day...
So the government & schools keep Financial Education hidden away inside a genie 🧞‍♂️ bottle.. The only way schools will "let the genie out of the bottle" is for you to be a Business Major or Finance Major in college.. Thats the only way the Government will let "THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG".. Thats the only way Formal Education will teach you any Investing Skills & Financial Education... As if only Business & Finance Majors need to learn how to invest their money & become millionaires.... Shouldn’t all High School students should be taught basic Financial Education BEFORE going to college, the military or Trade School.... Aren't you "SUPPOSEDLY" attending High School to learn about money, wealth, Financial Freedom, how to become a future millionaire & investing? So shouldn't  all High School students be taught the basics on how to choose good Dividend paying stocks, Growth Stocks, Blue Chip Stocks, REITS, treasury notes, Corporate bonds, Municipal Bonds & other investments?... Shouldnt all High School students be taught how to read a Wall Street Journal? Shouldn't all High School students learn basic Financial Terms such as Stock Dividends, Dividend Yield, P/E Ratio, Rule of 72, Stock Splits, Earnings Per Share, Market Cap, Dollar Cost Averaging,  Initial Public Offering & Dividend Payout Ratio ?.. Even learn the differences between a ROTH IRA & TRADITIONAL IRA investing accounts... Financial Education is not taught to keep the masses believing that success comes from working hard on a job all your life.. Thats how the government keeps the masses plugged into the Matrix laboring on jobs.. You are being taught how to work hard on a Hamster Wheel.. You ARE NOT being taught how to invest to become a millionaire & have assets working for you.. As Robert Kiyosaki explains in his Financial books "The government wants schools to keep Financial Education untaught, hidden & out of sight"
So from Kindergarten through High School, the school system wont even give you 1 book, 1 course, 1 lesson, or 1 class on Financial Education.. You're going to graduate High School knowing absolutely nothing on how to invest in stocks, bonds, businesses, IRA's, REITS, mutual funds, Treasury Notes, Gold, and real estate... But schools have prepared you well on how to "invest your time & labor" working a job all your life.. $10,000 invested in Cisco in 1990 is worth over 4 Million today.. $10,000 invested in Monster Energy Drink in 1996 is worth over 20 Million today... $15,000 invested in Amazon in 1997 is worth over 16 Million today.. $15,000 invested in Autozone in 1991 is worth over 1.5 Million today.. $10,000 invested in Starbucks in 1992 is worth over 2 Million today.. $10,000 invested in Microsoft in 1987 is worth over 4 Million today.. $10,000 invested in Netflix in 2002 is worth over 2 Million today.. $10,000 invested in Home Depot in 1981 is worth over 25 Million today.. 10K invested in Oracle in 1987 is worth over 4 million today... Schools train your mind to see JOB OPPORTUNITIES only. Schools dont train your mind to see INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES .. Students & young people, please wake up & not allow schools & the government to indoctrinate you into thinking you're living life just to "work hard on a job, pay bills, save & die".. The government has a simple 2-Step program to indoctrinate & control you... 1) Dont allow Financial Education in schools to keep your Financial I.Q. at ZERO... 2) Only allow schools to teach you to work hard on a job all your life as your only means of income... This is why most people go through life depending on a Corporation as their only means of income and have no Income Streams that work for them... Warren Buffett has over 60 Income Streams working for him (Income from Businesses & Stock Dividends).... Teach yourself Financial Literacy & become a millionaire.
Folks, no President or Politician will ever try to fix or reform the Censored & Corrupt educational system.... Its too convenient for politicians to rule over a nation of people educated to be "Hard Working Corporate Sheep" 🐑 & Cogs lacking Financial Skills to escape off their Corporate Hamster Wheels. As George Carlin famously said paraphrased, "Governments don't want well educated people capable of critical thinking... Governments want OBEDIENT WORKERS.. People just smart enough to run the machines & just dumb enough to passively accept it"..... Governments want our lame schools to just train you enough to push the buttons on your Corporate Hamster Wheel 8 hours a day... Governments DO NOT want teachers showing you how to earn income from Real Estate, REITS, Stock Dividends, Bonds or owning a Business... A High School teacher will be fired for even trying to teach you Investing Skills... Thats how censored & corrupt the school system is folks... "ALL STUDENTS" are supposed to learn about wealth, money & investing. But our lame government only want "College Business Majors" to have that valuable education.. The government fears having too many Financially Educated people in society will create too many millionaires & not enough Employees for Big Corporations to hire & exploit for 40 years of hard labor... To learn more on how our corrupt schools brainwash students into becoming Corporate Sheep please read the following books... "CASHFLOW QUADRANT" by Robert Kiyosaki... "CONSPIRACY OF THE RICH" by Robert Kiyosaki... "DUMBING US DOWN" by John Taylor Gatto and "WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION" by John Taylor Gatto.... Go to YouTube & watch the 1980 music video "ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL" by Pink Floyd also... Pink Floyd wrote the song to protest the brainwashing of students way back in 1980...
Go to any High School graduation or College graduation with a Wall Street Journal... Ask any graduating student to open the Wall Street Journal & pick 5 good Dividend Stocks, 5 good REITS, or 5 good Blue Chip Stocks.. About 98% of these students would fail. These students cant even define a Dividend Stock, REIT or a Blue Chip Stock.. These graduating students also cant even read the stock charts or stock tables inside the Wall Street Journal.. Again, the government needs for you to be Financially Ignorant to keep you glued to Corporate Hamster Wheels your entire life. This is why the government doesnt allow Financial Education in schools.. It's much easier for the government to control you & keep you slaving on a job all your life when you have no Financial Education. The government wants you highly skilled & trained for the CORPORATE WORLD, yet wants you completely dumb and ignorant for the FINANCIAL WORLD... 🤔 🤔
Good books on Financial Education are "Stock Market Investing For Beginners" by Tycho Press.. "Stock Investing For Dummies" by Paul Mladjenovic.."The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham.. "One Up On Wall Street" by Peter Lynch.. "The Little Book Of Common Sense Investing" by John Bogle.. "The Alchemy Of Finance" by George Soros.. "Automatic Millionaire" by David Bach.. "Real Estate Investing Made Simple" by Grant Cardone.. "Learn To Earn" by Peter Lynch... "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki & "Cashflow Quadrant" by Robert Kiyosaki.. All books by Robert Kiyosaki are great... Id also recommended subscribing to the Wall Street Journal newspaper, Forbes magazine & Fortune magazine.. Also watch CNBC or Bloomberg TV as much as you can... Stocks I recommend to buy & hold for the next 20 years include Amazon, Alphabet , Shopify, Alibaba, Ferrari, Berkshire Hathaway Class B & Netflix.. Folks, the government has to "feed off your FINANCIAL IGNORANCE" to survive & function.. People with no financial education have no option but to slave all their life on Corporate Hamster Wheels.. Again, that's why the government doesnt allow Financial Education in schools.. The government wants you to only know how to earn income from your HARD LABOR instead of by owning HARD ASSETS that work for you.. Dont allow the school system to mold you into a mindless "DRONE" with no Financial Skills

@ya_girls_favorit got you dude
Was this the one that you could turn upside down and play it 'back to front!??'. My bro had this and i was always 'borrowing' it to play California Games!! I was unbeatable at Surfing and Hackisack!!😉👍
@my.retro.tech very good deal. I could put it on eBay right now and make about £100
@retroexistential 😂😂😂
It’s a POS. But it’s a damn fun POS! 🕹
Alien vs predator
Alien Vs Predator 100%!!! One of my all time favourite games! Doom and Wolfenstein were awesome ports on this as well!
@retromarisa 😂😂
@the_former_games_tester but I'm sure you'll be enjoying playing it instead!
Definitely get Alien Vs. Predator if you can.  Rayman, Cannon Fodder, and Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy are also quite good, though I think I'm the only person who likes Trevor McFur.
Mate.... I had them all at one point but obviously doom is the highlight
@my.retro.tech you bet!!!
Alien Vs Predator 💯
I always thought these were over priced and over rated at the time, also a lack of proper support from game devs? Aesthetically it reminds me of the “Barcode Battler” 🙈😂👍😎
I had one of those the controllers had special plastic inserts that go on the number pad and each one had a different action. AVP was class,  I had cybermorph too but yeah that was pretty pants tbh.
@the_former_games_tester definitely Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Especially if you can get a complete Wolfenstein. That’s a pretty sweet collection. Enjoy! 🕹
You finally got one 😊
"When did you learn to fly"
@modern_and_retro_gaming_mama oh yeah! 😀
@the_former_games_tester congratulations dude 💪
@modern_and_retro_gaming_mama thanks :)
hard to get games for that from what ive heard but very sort after
My mate had one when they came out. Massive controller with what resembled a telephone dialing handset! Can't remember what games he had or what I played. Nonetheless I wasn't impressed. 64 bit console my ass!
I did, quick review, cybermorph was shit, AVP was awesome, there were other games but not many and no one bought them. Controller was massive.
I had one! Loved it! I had Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, Alien vs Predator...I’d recommend Doom, but then it’s time obviously very familiar. Alien vs Predator was good too, very atmospheric.
alien vs predator was always a game I was desperate to play on this.
@green_man_dan I want that but it's quite expensive
I have three of these and I genuinely don't know why.... Of all the things I collect, I went dumb with the Jaguar for some reason lol. At least I picked up a Jaguar CD before it became $1,000,000
Cool 👍 never played this one
Omg
That thing had the maddest controllers, hook a card over the telephone like keypad 🤔
Wow!
Nice acquisition! These babies are going for serious money these days. Hope you got a good deal. 👏
Very cool man! I still enjoy the Atari stuff even if I was a bit young at the time to truly appreciate it. There is a certain sound and feel to a classic arcade filled with those cabs. I’m going to feel the same way when the NES stuff falls by the wayside because the majority of the population age is focused on the next generation. It seems the peak right now is for the SNES and Genesis which was already my second console, but for many their first.
I thought that was a pog at first
@sixteen_bit haha. Welllllll retro stretches further and further forward. All these kids and their 32 bits!
@turbothunder16 2600 was definitely my first love. I'm hoping to get my son on it when he gets to that age. Joystick and one button was perfect for toddler Cam. 😂
@acartridgegamer Very true, but that doesn't mean the classics automatically get ejected. Not for me anyway.
@sixteen_bit I mean I would take Atari over a lot of the 32 bit era...
Glad it found a good home
@acartridgegamer The 2600 offers some of the most competitive couch versus that video games can offer. Wanna scream at your TV? Good old Combat will do it every time.
The 2600 was my childhood console (not counting that Rally IV Pong clone). Know your roots, as they say.
@therealdire51 Same here!
That's pretty neato!
Sad that the 2600 has died off, such a charm to it
You remember jungle hunt? Was toward the end of the 2600s life
@milkhouse_guitars Absolutely! Those natives jumping back and forth at the end. 😂
@sixteen_bit  remember the music  while they were doin this ?
@sixteen_bit  remember the music  while they were doin this ?
@milkhouse_guitars I do!
@sixteen_bit  good times!
@milkhouse_guitars The best of times!
That is SICKKKKKK
I like the sound they make when I scratch them. It’s the simple things in life.
@sixteen_bit I think I have one for ya
Remember when people on here cared about the old stuff?
@acartridgegamer I could be wrong, but isn't that the reason we're here to begin with?
@jaybaamofficial Ohhhhh I'll bet you do.
They will soon when the vcs come out
That's so cool!! Thanks for sharing dude!!
@mrhotlineking I believe you mean IF it ever comes out.
So nice!!!!!! 😊😊😊😊😊

Get a desk or gaming location.
@adolfoherrera278 I had a desk years ago but never used it. I’ll see what works moving forward.
Looks great! If it works for you, the better! You should feel comfortable while streaming, if I would have a setup, it would look the same, don’t have a desk or a specific gaming location 🙈😂 Good luck and have fun!! 🙌🏼

Pero mija, si la boca es preciosa, es monísima, como Cyril (aunque Josekawa y Claude me parecen a mi juicio más monos xd) [inserte aquí mensaje subliminal para que subas el dibujo de Sylvain haciendo morritos]
@miss_celiusk JSKAJSKS Gracias!! Lo de la boca es porque al ver el dibujo en espejo, como que está un poco torcida?? Pero me llevó bastante tiempo hacerla en el boceto así que me conformo con esta, que no está nada mal xd Bueno, ellos son monísimos, pero es algo subjetivo (?? Y ya lo subiré, seguramente en un doodle/sketch dump junto a otros personajes infravalorados (cofcofminuevawaifuyelnuevohusbandocofcof)

Hey sky I tagged you in some art in my account feel free to take a look love the event so far!
@haven_benham I’d love to play with you!
Hey! I’m looking for a few friends to play around with- perhaps to help with the season challenges and the hidden forest? I’m stuck on the temple in the forest! I’m fairly new to the game so help and pointers are much appreciated!
Where do I find my emotes on the emote tab? I can’t find it even though I already unlocked the ones you get from the isle and the prairie. I’ve been having this issue for a while
The lighting or maybe the colour texture here is amazing
After season ends, am I able to get the seasonal pass holder stuff without the season pass?
Yeah, i got that emote, but idk how to use it 😬
@claky_sky expensive,_, for me it is expensive,_,
@claky_sky but if I try I can 🤔right?
@haven_benham let’s be friends!!🙌
@haven_benham i play daily so i guess pretty regularly as wel 😁 would love to add you!
@haven_benham I would love to be your friend on Sky! uwu✨
🔥pleaae subscripe chanell bigstaroblox link is in bio 🔥🔥 its gamer.ahoj som😀😀 youtuber bigstaroblox daj mi prosim odber na kanal odkaz najdes v profile alebo staci jednoducho napisat do vyhladavaca bigstaroblox dakujem pekne 🔥
@thatskygame I’m having trouble playing with friends at the moment for the past few days keeps separating us and not letting us follow. I have tried contacting you and have not heard anything? For a game that’s so expensive why is there so much trouble? And why am I being ignored?
@skam.jisooya yes ,sure! If you see in the list of emotes with a friend (like hug,hold hands etc) there are also piggy back 1 and high five with two hands 1 . Only the second upgrade to these two emotes need the seasonal spirits .
@dinochos my too 😂😭
Me too
It won’t let me level my friendship up with my friend😕 at all😕 and we have enough
I'm really excited for the Android release but I'm kind of sad I'm missing the fun😢
@claky_sky yeeee, I can’t get the pass but the capes look really nice this season
Check out my Gaming Poll on my story to vote which games you think are the best ❤️🔥✌️
@haven_benham I l would love to be friends with you!
@madimousse_ I love making new friends! It definitely is challenging sometimes to make true friendships that will actually play with you instead of just trading hearts, but don’t worry, they will come eventually! ☺️ If you want, let’s go on a candle adventure together!
@adeline_pines yeah they do, right ? I like the colours a lot . And the way they look like a flower 😊 I couldn't get the pass either . A friend of mine bought the pass that you pay 5 dollars more and you can give it also to 2 friends.. So she gave me a pass! 😊 the last season I didn't have the pass, so now I'm enjoying having the quests and this season in general!
@adeline_pines anyway , you can buy a blue cape for 25 hearts from the spirit of vault that prays, I've been using it with the mask of this season (that is a white towards blue) and they look very nice together! That and the hat and your character will look very nice! And the umbrella too! If I'm not mistaken, you can get the umbrella without the adventure pass 😊
@madimousse_ don't  be shy! On sky you can find very kind and selfless people! I really found beautiful people on sky, this community is awesome!
@aizawa.is.scared yes there is, but you don't necessarily need the seasonal spirits to unlock piggy back 1 and high five with two hands 1 :)
@aizawa.is.scared and they don't cost a lot, if I remember it right, I payed for one of these upgrades around 4/5 candles and my friend payed for the other one, the same amount of candles
For the next event can you make je season candle easier to get, because with free play, you can’t get all the free item
This game is cool but I honestly don’t get what to do
@claky_sky ooo that sounds awesome! I’ll look into the umbrella, I heard there was a new one that you can get from the whale spirit in the forest too, but I’m not sure if that’s true. Thank you so much for the tips tho wow 💗
The next season should be mainly based off of sea/swamp creatures, with masks of frogs and fish, the elder could have a turtle mask, and the wings could all have water particle effects or something
HELL YEAHHH
@p.henriquem @mairaroyal
I was part of the stack
@adeline_pines *that hat , sorry
@aizawa.is.scared no, you can unlock the piggy back 1 just with 4 or 5 candles. To unlock the piggy back 2 (the one in this picture) you have to unlock the seasonal spirit.
@paddelyn you're welcome 😊
sky ples... android release... we miss you 💕💕💕
My friends unlocked it as soon as it was available! And it’s super cute when she’s in her chibi form giving me a piggyback ride 😂
Idk how, but if anyone wants to try to add me, I play the game quite a bit. I honestly don’t have friends who play, so if anyone wants to goof off or sometime maybe we can try adding each other 🤗 I send hearts and stuff pretty regularly too. Maybe eventually I’ll unlock the piggy back emote at some point lol
This game will release to LG devices?
@claky_sky yeah. Theres a constellation barrier that requires all the other spirits before you can collect it though.
@haven_benham I’d love to play
Ok wait can you post pics in the comments on instagram?
@madimousse_ we can be friends🥰
@haven_benham i would love to add you & be friends!
@askychild sweet! I’ll see if I add you!
@guacamoe.hh yay! I’ll try to send my scan code to you
Pure awkward when you actually use it
@claky_sky youre totally right lol! I think I’m part of my problem too because I’m way to shy for my own good :p
@guacamoe.hh hell yeah bro! I love makin friends
@madimousse_ I have quite a few “friends” 😂 when I first started out I naively just gave everyone my candles and now more than half of them don’t interact with me 😂😂💔
@sleepy.sky.kid unfortunately no you cannot 😔
But we could do this before but in a different way ( holding each other’s hands )
Yayy
My friends and I did a triple stack, it was so beautiful :,)
do you need to have the adventure pass to unlock it? thank y’all so much for everything you do!!!!!
A friend and I hurriedly got enough candles to unlock piggybacking the day it came out :) I love it
I love this game
nobody wants to be my friend in game lol, I have two friends that are active and send hearts but nobody wants to goof around with me :c
For some reason i thought this was a post about Android release
@randybowmann it’s something u can unlock with your friends!
@abilai.art expensive?
@paddelyn no you don't! You just unlock it with candles on the friends menu with the friend you want to unlock it (like hug or high five) . To unlock the piggy back 2 (the one in this picture) , you have to have unlocked the first one, and then you have to unlock it from the seasonal spirit that has it . Only then you can unlock with your friend on the same menu the piggy back 2. The same goes with high five with two hands :)
@aizawa.is.scared I do that and end up with random players from other countries lol
@claky_sky thank u so much!!!
@madimousse_ Well, maybe depends the way you approach ? For example, I find very annoying when a player comes to me and immediately ask me friendship, we never met and they do it without having even walked with me .. the friends I've made on sky are the ones I played with in some occasions , saved some spirits together or faced other adventures together... And now I have two friends with whom I play all the time! Then I have other friends , but we are not that close, we just hang out sometimes .
@sage_leaf_ I saw like 2 other people in Eden but then we went into seperate servers after a certain area
@jon.dbz IKR
Aww.. that's cute!
@skam.jisooya I remember it costed 5 candles the piggy back 1 .. how is this expensive? O.O the number 2 costs 4 candles, again, not expensive at all.. comsidering that everyday you can make 16 candles and 5 seasonal candles ..
@randybowmann you need to find all the season spirits to unlock the cave in the first world to get it
@adeline_pines me too! I haven't unlocked anything yet because I want that cap and the cape after it!
@thatskyexperience my friend and I did that too 😂

That's cool!!
I'm so gonna try this 🤣 @ijpmedia
what happened?
@530fig When you shoot a non enemy npc, they don't take damage. But once they transformed into an enemy, the arrow did damage.
XD PERFECT
@kocheekour oh ima do that shit 😂
😂😂😂😂 thanks for the tip ima shoot everybody with an arrow now 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's really cool!
What what???
U go ZA WARLUDO then speak to him and once u leave he’s done

I liked the Yiga Clan thing but you can always tell who it is
I liked the Yiga Clan thing but you can always tell who it is
The fucking moan she makes played super loud in the middle of my quiet house at night
@ddaller459 this is how we’re supposed to take care of them!
Smart 1000
WOW👏👏👏👏
You can tell it's a Yiga Clan by their name. An actual traveler has a name displayed, but this traveler is called traveler. And those 'travelers' are always yiga clans.
Beast!!!🔥🙌💀
I see you want an unlimited supply of ammo and never have to reload
@kickin_it_country_89 yes exactly it’s not really that much to ask for tbh
@bluebellegaming but then the fun of you not being able to aim and getting killed with a solid headshot would go away
I don’t know. Reloading seems pretty 👌. to be honest that rate of fire and the rounds in the magazine seemed a little yikes though. Maybe more in it and a tad slower? I wouldn’t know. I Don’t play apex
@the_groovy_guitar_guy *tempt* 🌚
@kickin_it_country_89 👓
@kickin_it_country_89 those are for your considering it seems like you’re blind as hell. Either that or watching a different video than I am.
@kickin_it_country_89 damn talk about being rude an a horrible person. If only your parents taught you how to be man and be respectful 🤦🏽‍♂️👋🏽✌🏽
@rg79m he must not know you don’t get girls attention by being mean to them anymore 🤷🏻‍♀️
@spookybutttouchs one I was not saying she can’t aim if you have an unlimited amount of ammo and never reload everyone would just run around constantly firing there would really be mo true skill to the game
@spookybutttouchs think is soul is still lost💁🏽‍♂️
Dude my dude damn that was crispy🙌🙌
@kickin_it_country_89 perhaps wording the comment a little better would have been more well received, just sounded like you were being rude
@kickin_it_country_89 being a prick and feedback are 2 different things. Don't be a prick ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10/10 would let you carry me agane
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 seriously you guys need a life lord Jesus get a life
@sinatraa_f omg get out stop 😂

@my.gamess of cooourse of coursee😏😏😏😏
Oh so ging es mir auch😂 In Super Mario 64 gibt es einen langen Gang mit dem Bild von Peach am Ende und wenn man näher kommt, verwandelt es sich auf einmal in Bowser. Das fand ich auch total creepy😱😅
This is my favorite game!! 💗 I was TERRIFIED of big boo in the hallway and would always turn straight back and head to the basement instead of the courtyard 😂
Ich mochte dieses Wasser Level nicht 🙈 Hab den Controller dann immer weggelegt oder ihn meinem Bruder gegeben 😂 Ich mag diese Wasser Level Heutzutage aber auch nicht wirklich 😅😂
I think the first game I played was a Spongebob or Nickelodeon one
Ohh das ist ja ne süße Erinnerung 💕 kann mich daran erinnern, sehr früh super Mario World und Ocarina of time mit meiner Mutter gespielt zu haben.. Aber ich weiß nicht ob das echt meine ersten waren 😅
Love this
Memories 😍
Omg Bowser was so scary! And he was so big compared to Mario I was like 😭😦
👌😍😍😍
Loving that delicious red controller! 😍😍
@_alex.boom_ jaa als Kind findet man sowas einfach total gruselig😂🙈
@10eestudio haha so true!!😂💕
@purplegamingx jaa kenn ich! Fand es auch immer viel schlimmer unter Wasser Gegnern zu begegnen als and Land😂
@lostnmygames so cute! I also had a Spongebob game💕
Fing bei mir mit Tetris an und dann Mario Bros 😄
Omg I was soooo scared of the laugh too I’m glad it wasn’t just me 😂😂😂 mine was ocarina of time✨ love this shot💕
Man this takes me back 😅
Mein aller erstes Spiel müsste Super Mario auf der Nintendo Nes gewesen sein 🤔 wir hatten leider selbst keine N64, aber mein Bruder konnte mal eine ausleihen und das war so cool (ich durfte nur zusehen, aber es war dennoch cool 😆)
Das war so geil 😂
That was nice 🙌
🌞I hope you have an amazing Monday! 💕

@dorantescleyton all these gears funkos are custom made and are for sale
Respect ✊ 😉

Damn, what a journey😱 Congrats! 😎
@hyrulelegacy and Mario and the time machine 😂
Omg the whole mario set👏👏
@chills.exe awesome fella well done 👍 I didn’t even know there was that many Mario games 😀
@keepfronting you know what I actually started doing that - taking pics of the credits but I stopped early on - too much faff lol
@dailygam3r thanks! Erm honestly not too sure I wasn't keeping track. A rough average would be 10 hours per game so 220 hours maybe? I know I spent much longer on some games than others so maybe closer to 300 hours
@frenchretro_pdx 😎✋
@alex_r_m85 😎
@gba_dreams thanks! It's kinda nice it's over haha you can only take so much Mario
@ydthecollector yep every one completed! I've already started planning my side quest - playing all spin off and side games 😎
@huggybear.retrogamer cheers! 😎 Ha yeah and these are just the mainline games - there's so many other spin offs like Paper Mario and Super Mario RPG that I'll be tackling in the future
@chills.exe nice im almost there bro i just need to beat super mario bros u amd thats it but keep it up
@ydthecollector that's a pretty solid 2D Mario! I can see why they released it for the Switch 👍
Nice. Looking forward to seeing the list 👍🏻. Gonna be tough to put together
Congratz. Thats a fun thing to do 😊
@questforsnes it really was! I'd recommend doing it if you can
@chills.exe i've beaten them all but not in the right order 🤔i've always jumped around since there's so many of them. So wich one was the favorite?
Yay!! Can’t wait to see these rankings!! 😍

@lootfeed lol it don’t
😂😂😂
Ness’s down air
coolest is ganon's down b
K rook back hand
Gunners up-b
@king.k.rool.krown h e l l y e a h
Corrin’s side smashes are really good for poking and forcing spacing. Up is great and chains into itself sometimes and down’s a good knock off option, but the sides? They kill, they cuck...they’re just good.
ike up b because my brother with no skill at the game can spam that and beat me
@zdog35917 I agree with it being boring. Forward air spikes are boring
@thehugeretardation no way! They’re one of the best things in the game!
@amiibo21 imo it’s the most boring f-air spike in the game
Snake Fair, Ganon Dair, Nana (Ice Climber) Fair
@d.eblag short hop dair with Ganon is great against characters with a more grounded playstyle.
JOKER WITH ARSENE DOWN AIR
Ness's Dair
Luigi down taunt
Ganondorf’s down air
@smashbrosmemez I’ve never SDs after punishing with it
Ganondorf, Ivysaur and Luigi Taunt.
Ganon  or Wario
Ganondorf Down B hardly used since it’s so hard to get the spike but if you get hit by it might as well quit and unplug your controller
Mii Brawler's soaring axe kick spike is actually pretty good.
Lucas pk freeze- it gets me all the time 😥
Getting Spiked by little Mac will actually end your entire career
U haven’t been uploading much?
Lil mac dair
The fuck u meant nastiest smash
King DEDEDE as a whole
Bayonetta down smash Is beautiful
Ganon’s dair. Nuff said
Luigi’s down taunt is the scariest and most disrespectful.
@stoopidkid364 They did, before the whole move sweet spotted, but now only the outer hitbox doesn't spike as hard. Still broken tho.
I main PT and Link so they slap, but the win HAS to go to Plant Dair. This move is so disrespectful...
Yeah but what i meant is they didnt make the hitbox of the whole move smaller
@stoopidkid364 Agreed. I main PT and that move is unacceptable.
I’m not saying yoshi fair is nastier than Mario fair but I will say I survived 2 flair blitzes by trading with yoshi fair
@lecomptequisertarien see Sakurai, even the Pokémon Trainer mains don’t like that move.
@literally_just_tim No, don't get me wrong, I love it, but I know jank when I see it
king k rool back air are u kidding me 😂😂😂 that shit is so dirty
Imma just be real with you the best spike is either Ganandorf or ivysaur.
@hutchinwin Yea it's got some windup before actually coming out.
Snake’s Fair is slow but it kill at extremely low percents
@ch0pp3r.it I agree. It takes some finesse to pull off. And its fun right under the ledge.
@izzyw_isaiah20 I'm getting teary eyed just thinking about it.
@steve_malatt
Dr Mario’s side f smash
Donkey kong
We talking spikes or smash attacks now?
@izzyw_isaiah20 nah man im the one spiking out here 😎
Captain falcon's double stomp
Are you aware of the character kirby
Luigi down taunt
They didnt nerf the hitbox and the hitbox is why its broken so its still broken
@king.k.rool.krown you think it’s boring?
Donkey Kong down Special is my favorite
Ness pk fire
Melee ganon ain’t nothing ever hit like that
Bayonetta’s down smash spike is great the opponent is unaware of it
Either piranha plant or dr mario they are underrated
playing against Luigi in a competitive match, but then he down taunts, causing you to get spiked, now that's depression
Mario F-Air>Up taunt is a fate worse than death
@smashbrosmemez ahhh
@smashbrosmemez it's still busted
Donkey kongs forward air
Krool Back-air
@amiibo21 its boring
Y’all don’t realize how precise the timing is to spike with Bowser down-b or Luigi down taunt
@jz.i231 if you time it on the platform right you can use it pretty often. All about timing.
@smashbrosmemez and you will if u jump off the platform try to hit a dair and miss. But if you just run off you still have your jump so even if you miss youre alright. Timing gotta be right. Takes practice
Ganon dair, this shit spikes at 10-20% and I mean like spike deadly
@smashbrosmemez it’s still bad lmao
@smashbrosmemez up air still broken af tho
@d.eblag Ye true. It could also be a ledge trap or tech chase option.
@smashbrosmemez nerfed but still just as disgusting as ever lmao
Dr. Mario and Plant down air are really underrated
Aye You ever get spiked by Captain Falcons up Tilt
Little Mac Dair... :)
@jz.i231 ganon’s bair and some good timing is his best ledge trap. Or his nair. But dair is definitely a good tech chase option
little mac. i’ve never been hit by it but imagine the shame of being spiked by a fucking little mac
Bayonetta's Down A
the best spike is under stage rest

K Rool b-air 💀
Ganon’s dair is underrated
@ch0pp3r.it wowowow how did I forget
@d.eblag it's such a large hit box and I feel like you're gonna SD after lol
@smashbrosmemez Idk man but I forgive you for forgetting 😳
Mario’s F-air
Well, if I’m being real, I’d say Ivysaur. That down air has the most fricked up hotbox in the game.
@amiibo21 its pretty sickk
@literally_just_tim truee but it's been nerfed!!
@d.eblag When would you use it though? It’s good but usually ganon has a lot of range so hitting that low and close is uncommon
looks so cute! 🍃 especially with rilakkuma & korilakkuma hiding in the tree! 🐻💕
@mayor.maple Thank you 💜
So peaceful
Naww this pic looks sooo nice! I love acnl nature😍💗

А че он так быстро стреляет?
@vidziksimfoniy две кнопки соединил и быстро кликает по ним. Не зажимает а кликает
@dr_14.12 бред какой то если честно нужно это фиксить
@vidziksimfoniy он все же зажимает. Две для того чтобы не промахнуться по кнопку
@dr_14.12 а что тогда мешает сделать её большую?
@_fesa_21_ то кликает то зажимает не понятно
@_fesa_21_ вдоль тоже больше будет, а так только поперек. Или по другому, тупаю вдоль и поперек
@vidziksimfoniy зажимает, там видно
Для нуба да
@_fesa_21_ 2 сразу нажать и я так же буду быстро стрелять?

@momen.hx but the disruptor is gone so maybe the same amount of unfair fights?
@jaitupe sounds lit
You guys should check out my twitch. I try to stream as much as possible, but no consistent streaming schedule yet. I try to be the best at everything I play, but like everyone else I rage, so if you like seeing that then just watch me for a bit. https://www.twitch.tv/spzwnz
@tyler_kellyrawr
@jebaeza
Are you fucking kidding me wtf is this bullshit
@min7yfr3sh fair enough
R they keeping p2020 hopup
@this_skill Eva has always been viable bro it slaps w a purp bolt
@captain_stark11 what wrong with it?
Nice
@flameheadd yeah, but r301 and  flatline are. That's 2.
@lukeroosin I’m sure it’ll come back by the end of the season. I’m sure in season 4 we will have both maps to play with
Who needs a hemlock anyway
I want all of em
@lukeroosin the point of the season is called “Meltdown” it makes sense why they are wanting us to be on the new map.
@vicwizzles yup, a while ago a night mode got leaked, as well as some weird spider creatures. Its only a rumour tho but hope its true
@lukeroosin its called changing up the meta
@lukeroosin aaa I feel like it’s fun! Spices things up! Also changes the meta like the others said; idk it’s better than fortnite where they’ve had the same map for ages and continue to mess it up,, it’s better than that and honestly I’d love some funky fun!
Useful
I LOOOOVE THE G7 IM EXCITED FOR THIS
@lukeroosin it’s fine change isn’t always a comfortable thing to go threw, but Respawn probably knows what there doing and the stuff things have make up for losses
@min7yfr3sh not rly, made 2 guns unviable and made 2 popular ones even more popular
Ok this is amazing
My favourite gun was already the G7😍😍
The eva 8 is gonna aids to fight against now
Uhhh ohhh the Eva 8 just became viable...
@gizzump
Oh my 😍
The Eva was already dangerous with a shotgun bolt, this is going to make it into a UN threat
@lukeroosin or they could have multiple maps somewhat like PUBG
@lukeroosin or they could have multiple maps somewhat like PUBG
@jkoivune don’t get me wrong I’m still mad about that but I rather them take and give instead of just take
more unfair fights! yay!
@sebasrivera504 🤯🤯🤯 night mode will make bloodhound 🔥🔥🔥🔥
@bryan.el.ramver
Spicy 😏
This makes up for the loss of disrupter rounds
@stripper_snake oop
It's okay but still an eh, would have to see how it does in-game
@adrianincarnati
What is respawn doing? Got rid of the original map, and now they got rid of two hop ups? Like what the fuck
@lukeroosin but they added two new ones bro I think it’s cool letting them experiment
@t00000b I guess, still bugs me tho. And there’s no reason to remove the whole ass map
Not like the eva is already cancer but 👌👌🗿
Much needed
@lukeroosin I saw somewhere that it will only be removed on the first 1 or 2 weeks, and then It will return in night mode for a halloween event, makes sense tho.
@sebasrivera504 omg really??🤩
شكلي باخذ السويتش

Ma cosa è successo al padre di pow3r ho visto anche un video su youtube di questa scena ma non c'era scritto nulla
👏👏
@simone_di_mauro__ purtroppo é morto di cancro 😢
👏👏
❤
Mi sono commosso, secondo me Giorgio oltre che essere un bravo gamer e anche una bravissima persona che merita il meglio❤️
L’orgoglio della community italiana ❤️
Poverino
Grande @pow3r continua così tutte queste difficoltà vanno affrontate e tu lo hai fatto al miglior modo possibile complimenti
Perdonatemi per la mia sgarbatezza, ma io ho avuto di peggio. Parto già dal fatto che mi dispiace per @pow3r, perché in qualche modo mi sono sentito vicino a lui in quel momento, ma oltre a mia madre, malata di cancro, ci furono anche molti grossi colpi, nel lontano 2014... Ora non sto a raccontare tutto, ma comunque mia madre mentre stava ad operarsi per uscire da quella situazione, mio padre se la faceva con la cognata di mia madre. E si è preso anche i 120000€ che mia madre aveva fatto risparmiando negli anni. E tutto ciò, mi è successo nel giro di qualche mese.
@pow3r il migliore in tutto ❤️ solo stima per lui
Ei, potresti mandarmi il video? Vorrei pubblicare anch'io un articolo per lui... Grazie in anticipo
@truppo_mikyy stessa situazione ma al contrario a lui il padre a me la madre
@scooby_damiano mi dispiace bro
Sei degno??

@gymleaderveda go karting was a blast! 😄 I’m glad I brought my SP. I played it so much and finished some games. It came in handy the most on days when I was at sea. 🌊 And that’s awesome you have the game also! This one is my childhood copy. Usually, my go to characters are Toad and Dry Bones. 🏁
@shadowwiidragon omg *sp my bad lol. GBA game 😂 yeah I can imagine! What games did you finish???
@gymleaderveda lol you’re fine! GBA is correct too! I finished Disney’s Magical Quest 2, Bruce Lee: Return of the Legend, and getting close to completing Drill Dozer. I also put some time into Pokemon Crystal. 😁
@gymleaderveda ooo have you had a chance to try Pokemon Pinball?
That's the coolest way to go-kart! That scenery looks amazing! 🏞🏎
Pray that you didn't lose(the GBA nor on the track) lol

@forevertableflip WEHHH THANK YOU!! 😭💓 (Probably helps that I've stared at these character designs for a couple dozen hours~ 😂😂) BUT YES KIND OF. You only see older Veronica in the pre-game menu cinematic. :') But Erik and her do have some banter and there's some hidden dialogue that implying he wants to her something. Mostly just a cute what-if scenario cause I like older Veronica's design. 🙈

Why no disrupter rounds😾 tf up with that!?
@hekker9 ja kheb just al ne video mee gameplay gezien mee crypto en daar ziede alles wa hier instaat ook wel in, behalve dan da skullpiercer en disruptor rounds weggehaald zijn wtf mijne longbow en mijne pathfinder ook nog is gefucked
Tbh I'm not a big fan of these changes
Man i loved that gold skull piercer and disruptor 😢
Shitty changes I’m tired of them nerfing pathfinder bcuz everybody else is shit. Why nerf the grapple then THATS ALL HE HAS LEFT, he already takes 5% more damage.
@sam_super_ah exactly now i gotta go back to wraith🙄
@ikobie en we waren al zo hard gefucked
Yeah i think they're trying to ruin the game. Pathfinder mains aren't gonna play, longbow was already slow.
@booduhboy @dustin.serrano.73 yeah i might be done with apex
@d3m3wilson agreed. WellCare how it ends up but so far, I don’t like it
Im might move to fortnite
@jason4reall
@d3m3wilson man man. No bueno
@christopherrogers8580
@_0db bro straight fucking facts
@sam_super_ah im sure you'll still be OP as pathy, just takes a bit to learn the new grapple timing i guess
@zachthenewkid_photography even after several nerfs it was still strong as hell
cant wait for tmr🔥
The dreaded path nerf 😪
The dreaded path nerf 😪
@the_sass_monster sum r good sum r bad but im with it
Ur bad if u use distupors use me as a like button who agrees
Im so looking forward to it even though disrupters are gon
@cambru22 dude this are sick updates
@asifzahir92
They have ultra fucked pathfinder.... my 12k pathy kills now shall never be seen again. Rip
@vansh_lorish they said they were balancing the weapons that way people would slaughter everyone but idk
@vicwizzles when’s the last time you actually found a skull piercer and used it on a wingman or longbow. Nerfing the longbow was all they needed to do
@vansh_lorish I always used it but like I said, I was watching a video and that’s what was said.
❤️
RIP to my social life
@rafiki_jee charge rifle isn’t a care package and the r301 is getting a buff.? Bro I’m already a beast with that gun now imagine
Longbow is already slow enough but ig
@flavsterss no

WOW! What a great post! We’re both new and upcoming gaming video creators and really wish we could hit some clips like this ourselves. We’ve checked out your page and really love your content, keep up the great work! Well deserved like 😊😜🎮
💣💣
@_robinvschaijk_ it doesn't look bad, honestly, from what I've seen the layout is pretty much the same as kings canyon. Just new buildings and areas lol. I'm happy to try this new map but at the same time disappointed
@_ray_tastic_ ofc its a good thing to get a new map, but they should mske both maps available.. As i realy loved skull town or labs, i am gonna miss labs so bad
@_robinvschaijk_ I'm gonna miss gauntlet dude, loved the jump pads. I get that the whole new map is mainly story wise, which is great and I love lore, but let us have the other map to just play around with y'know? Let us do our own thing
@_ray_tastic_ i never interested in lore of apex... So i have no idea, but yeah i get the pain on gauntlet. The last few areas they made were realy good. Gonna mis labs
@_robinvschaijk_ yeah I'm gonna miss everything about kings canyon,,,
@gizzump
Nah just make it two playlists 😕
We better see it ASAP
It will When you think about it you’ve moved to another world because the leviathans in the prowlers have overtaken it I don’t know but think about that like you know
They should add the map as a playground option
no not kings canyon🥺ima miss skull town
Wut
there probly be new event in kings canyon as we go to new dawn, maybe like it somehow destroyed by someone
That’s retarded why not have two available maps lol
embrace the change folks
I really hope that if they do bring back King's Canyon they add the original original look. Without Leviathans in the middle and no flyers and junk. I miss the way it was -_-
@thehuman.odlid  Double the servers they would have to support.
İn the titanfall 2 story there is a planet who captcured by IMC forces
@efe__mutlu009 İts look like destroyed but its can be alive İ mean the destroying world scene can be in another planet
@_ray_tastic_ same dude, makes me sad. But I bet there'll be another place like skull town where all the people will drop haha
Why can't we make our own characters in Apex???
@sebastian_dehli hahaha hvad er det for et sted overhovedet. Vi lander der aldrig
😭😭😭😭😭😭
@trillxpubstar queue times bro
@x___red_devil_elite___x no u
It'll probably come back in a season or two and it'll be upgraded and stuff , like they moved to world's edge so they'd be able to rebuild it
@stupify.exe it'd make sense from a sttoy perspective too !
@_cochamo_ Never been a problem for mez
@haleyacocella  wait what? completely new map? this new season seems really cool
With all of the money EA has I wish we could queue up for both maps 👀👀👀
Why not have both maps
@trillxpubstar queue times would go up if there were 2 different maps because there would be less people on each map so you’d have to wait longer to get a full match
@_cochamo_ Nonsense 😂
@vld_chase_ what?
@maui_jack true
We literally just got gauntlet and labs, are you serious??!?!?
Developers had a good reason for this at the start, but it would be ridiculous to have to wait a whole season to play Kings Canyon
@_ray_tastic_ y wtf
@_robinvschaijk_ i loved the town takeovers, too bad they'll be gone,,
@_ray_tastic_ same here dude... I actualy think this map will be horrible
NOOOOO MY BABY
I'm mad
@fuzziewompkins Can I be a character like Crypto, but instead of hacking I fill peoples screens up with Instagram posts?
I hope it comes back, but I'm not gonna be surprised if it doesnt
What no fuck this I wanna play Kings canyon all the time
Kings Canyon isnt gone theyre just repairing what was destroyed😇
@theapexpost only if you're right handed
Kinda dumb. Just leave both maps available for use.
@kody_mcnaughton hmm, interesting. I imagine it will return in another season with a load of changes. Probably all fucked up by the Leviathans.
Apex is gay
😭
@christopher_monschein @noahtopp kunne ikke være mere  ligeglad
@sebastian_dehli enig man kan ikke bruge det sted til en skid
NOOOOOOOO
Honestly disappointed with Respawn, had such high hopes for this game in Season 1. Haven’t played since the first week of season 2, game just got boring too quickly. Has some of the best gunplay on the market but that’s about it
it will be great if that map go back in season 4 or another event !!!
@mynameisjames7 should have stayed. They added new game modes, guns and other cool shit. And we're getting a new map tomorrow
@fasshhoo oh I played solos and the shotgun and snipers but still. Solos was pointless Apex is a team game, one new gun ( which only comes from a supply drop and 1 new legend a season isn’t cuttin it. The seasons are too long to have literally 1 event over 2/3 months
Bring back solos! Games horrible with fandoms
Ransoms
But when will you be a playable character in apex? 😳
Can't wait for tons of bugs on this new map!

@insomnie_nostalgeek You and I are the same I have too many games on my phone 😭 well the more distractions the better for me imo 😂
I downloaded it few days ago but when I saw that we need a Nintendo account I uninstalled it because I don't have one. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Is it necessary to have a Switch or something to play it? Or is it an ordinary account without any obligations?
@geek.disorder I'm not quite sure if you need a Nin account to play it? I mean I played it cause I already have one. But highly doubt you need a switch to play it. If it needs an account, just make a Nin account and that's it. 🤔
@knighthowler626 okay then. I don't really know why I haven't tried making this account? 🙃 Let's try it out then. 😄

Yeah you just going on holiday and when u get there Isabelle says ur the mayor🤔
also theres absolutely no re-elections??? once ur there ur there for life
excUSE ME they play animal crossing puzzle leage instead of debates and speeches!!!
@mr.green.been thats actually a thing in new leaf if you have a 3ds item you can interact with it to play AC puzzle league and the storu mode is basically all these other villagers challenging you as mayor and you have to outdo them in each level to win the approval of theother citizens
can we do this if donald trump gets reelected please its better to just grab any random person off the street djdjjd
Mayorhood is based solely on Isabelle’s approval.
@mr.green.been look at this little genius over here 😳🤝
Wasn't rover supposed to be the mayor?

Awesome! I actually don’t have that but would love to add it to the collection.
All good shooters usually have a cool soundtrack that stays with you. I played it on the DC this game is definitely super fun! 🔥
👍
@littledevil_71 it's worth it if you're a fan of the genre.
@turbothunder16 one of the major reasons why I love these games.
God-Shattering Star is a legit banger, wdym.
The virgin Apex of the World vs the Chad God Shattering Star👌👌.Sorry but its true
@eponahorse i am ferdinand von aegir
the mii maker theme is the only good song
@4gangar thats not a crit quote 🙄 but youre right thats also iconic
Am I the only one who felt the three houses critical quotes were really weak?
How dare ypu say that aboit god shattering star
Neither tbh
@leelee.ya “Prepare yourself” is a staple in the series...
god shattering star isnt overrated
@grimaisyoursavior not overrated
@i_watch_way_too_much_anime true
Neither because they’re both godlike
@blazing.lion.roy name a better one
Chasing Daybreak > God-Shattering Star
@send.marianne.pics.uwu I can name so many better ones. Even stuff like Dorothea switching from “all roses have thorns” to “only thorns left on this rose” beat pick a god and pray
As iconic as pick a god and pray has become there are so many stronger more impactful quotes out there in FE.
@blazing.lion.roy it doesnt have the same umph as Pick a God and Pray, to each their own
@leelee.ya periodt.
God shattering Star is the only reason I beat the Orphan of Kos in bb show some respevt
Say sike right now
Oh god theres 2 of them
@jordwibbs !ekiS
God Shattering Star is OD idk what you mean chief
What do you mean overrated?
Pick a god and pray. It’s been 6 years and people still think that’s the best FE quote
Lorenz Hellman Glouster X Ferdinand Von Aegir is best ship change my mind
Pick a god and pray is still THE most iconic crit quote idc
@star_falchion they shouldve had an a support
Both at this point, especially the crit quote
god is overrated
God-shattering star. Sorry but Apex of the World is the best final map song
Anime is overrated
But pick a god and pray is a badass quote :(
@leelee.ya period
here is something to believe in > pick a god and pray
God Shattering Star > Pick a god and pray by a long shot that song is OD wym
How dare
@leelee.ya IKR LIKE NAME A BETTER ONE ILL WAIT

@caleblindendesign 3 stuck with me cause they used an actual park I used to skate at in the competition levels. All love for 2 & 4 as well for sure though.
@gbread6 totally makes sense! That's awesome
Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 🔥🤘🏽🔥
Best games ever made ❤️
@josaph107 nice! One was great too
@by_nick dude they were my childhood. 😂🤘
@caleblindendesign grew up playing it in the McDonald’s across the street of my apartments.
It also showed me punk rock!
Great memories. The documentary should be great to watch
@josaph107 definitely great memories! That's awesome. I remember all the car rides with it haha
Underground was🔥🔥🔥🔥 too
@celinejewell I mean yeah. Truuuuuuuu. But for some reason I still gravitate back to these
Fuckin awesome dude!
@bengogolin thank you very much dude!
On PS1 I like THPS4 great soundtrack, one of favorite PS1 game and PS2 is Tony Hawk's American Wasteland cause of the free roam lol 😂
But you could be Wolverine in Pro Skater 3!!!
Definitely 2. That soundtrack formed my music taste to this day.
@masen_nichols dude me too haha. I could say same for both 2 and 4 too
@haziq_asari haha oh definitely! Love the soundtrack!
@antoniocarlisle99 haha fair point dude!
@caleblindendesign “get off the road”
2 and 4 were my favs as well! PS1 and PS2 🤙
1 & 3
@gbread6 hahaha so there exact opposites from me
I know right lol. When I read yours I was like 2 & 4? Many agree with your opinion I’ve talked too though.
I watched you play it a lot
@kylielinden time for you to start it up dude haha
@gbread6 they're all great tbh haha. Idk why 2 and 4 always stuck out to me though.
@merticalggs posted a banger trickshot 🌿
@solar.btw gotta dm it to @superleaguetv
the fact that fortnite is in this makes your video invalid
Anyone I need iTunes card😭 I can’t afford for it
@luvbatjerry body shield that is
Gold amour is now fast heal
Fast heals is gold body shield now
Yeah I’d rather heal myself then my trash teammate
@legendary_roberto *than
Can you confirm this is happening cause that's the stupidest thing I've heard
@tysonfahey_ I’m 100%
@mayor_of_apex fuck my life 😂 gold stabilizer only good gold thing anymore
@tysonfahey_ bro the Gold shield is the fast heal now
@mayor_of_apex truth? That's good cause when ever I finished someone that shit never got refilled this why I main lifline haha always fast heals ahah
@mayor_of_apex do you reckon they gonna decrease the spawn rate of gold sheild cause have the server have fast heals
This is an absolute downgrade, never picking up that "golden" bag now
NOOOOOO
They should make the golden armor heal us faster . This is much more consistent
NOOOO WHYYY
@secondseptimus you’re dumb as shit if you think purple is the new fast heal. You’re the type of kid to cry if your lifeline package gets stolen
That sucks
Fast heal is going to be on the body armor, so it is still in game ❤️
@mojood_zendeh they did. Gold shield has the backpacks ability now
They should make the body shield fast heal
@mayor_of_apex YES!!!
@mayor_of_apex good I was just about to ask about the gold body shield
@therealt_dubstep yeah
@therealt_dubstep they did
@andy.s.42 look up kandyrew on YouTube he got to play the new map and see all the new stuff early
Did the do anything with the knock down shield?
Nooooo i can never find gold armor 😂😂😂
@andy.s.42 All my sources are legit. And I can’t put links. Even if I did you would have to type it yourself. So if you wanna know more information I suggest you do your own research on other media sites.
legendary body shield now does the fast heal. it’s still in the game lol
@andy.s.42 Gold body armor does the fast heal now.
@stephenpindale the body shield does fast heal now.
@mayor_of_apex I’m not saying your post are not legit I’m just saying like so people can read up on it too and you don’t have to put a link directly just put in keywords that you used to look it up
@shakinmyjacon oh nice👌🏼
@shakinmyjacon oh nice👌🏼
The finisher perk for the good shield was pretty useless
@mrln.swns @sdnykllnrs
@bramdaelmans oeiiii
fast heal is on the gold shield now
@stephenpindale @dantebaruffi wtf
@dijamc24 why?? That’s a cool idea for a perk for a gold item, but why change it? Guess lifeline will be my main now
@loic_laixhay
@sircharles24 gold backpack was prolly the best thing in the game tbh
Rip Zylbrad
Fast heal is now on the gold chest plate
@wrxlth4 rip backpack fast heals
Lifeline/fast heal... was so much fun 😢
@akadrdre had the ability tp literally change games
@sircharles24 exactly bro
👎🏽
Literally could have put this on the gold knock down shield but I guess that’s cool
@wrxlth4 Gold Backpack was 
a brave one
A strong one
A handsome one
But most of all... the ultimate fast heal 🧰
No no no I hope this isn't the case 😢😢😢😢
Noooooooooo
You should put a link to your sources so we can read it for ourselves
Btw guys they changed the Gold Shield to Fast heal. Sorry for the heart attack 😐
@sensei.apex fax
NOOOOO
Fast heal will not be missed.

Omg nooooo
Why no one cares about that
Aight Imma leave it
No when you have a gold armor you can heal fast it just swapped
Watch zeus his video
Give people more of a reason to use lifeline
Wtf 🤨😒😒
kind of good change cuz golden backpack for life line was op

I love Jane and Kenny so much but I would definitely prefer Kenny cause he would never leave clem alone in danger and he will protect her anytime
@flam_xdgirl even if he got crazy he would never leave clem alone
I like Jane because she was nice to clementine. But Kenny is a much more important character. Kenny knew clementine from the beginning. And even though he makes some wrong decisions, he just wants Clem and AJ to be safe. And in s3, Jane kills her self without even telling clementine. Leaving her all alone with an infant. While Kenny dies trying to save Clem and AJ. Or he makes sure that Clem and AJ gets into Wellington or whatever. Kenny is one of the best characters in the game😅
@clem.entine_twdg i agreee
@flam_xdgirl facts
Mind checking out my recent I liked yours❤️

Hahaha never!!
“Why didn’t you heal!?” 😂😂😂
@nashcarver_nv I was so lost Lmao it was a lifeline too, like WTF Bruh 😂
I have 2 of these!!
@khwaterblock there great, I still prefer the EU version though, I have 2 of that one but still have to frame👌🏻
My favorite piece in your collection 😍and now I want one.lol very nice mate. 👏
Love it❤️ & the images from the game are amazing😄
@roxas_mastercloud thanks mate 😁 they aren’t hugely rare so you should be able to get one il let you know if I see one
What size is it!?! 😍
This is excellent, really like the images in the background too
@marcomatea around B2 size roughly
@kefka02 yeah same that’s why I chose to feature that side first as it’s quite unique 😁 my favourite still goes to the EU variant though !
@ty_wit_luv thanks! I think so too👌🏻
@soracloud3924 its really awesome!! Do you know where could I get a poster around 36x24 inches size of the classic kh 1 artwork? Similar to the one you show in this picture! Thanks and congrats on your amazing collection!!
@marcomatea you can get unofficial ones, as for official ones for KH1 it’s this one and other regions ones. The EU version is for Kh1 but expensive and rare. This one would be your best bet I think 👌🏻
@soracloud3924 much appreciative!!🙌😁
@soracloud3924 i think I didn't explain myself well enough, I'm not looking for this same two-sided poster you show, I'm just looking for a poster of the kh classic artwork that you say is your all time favorite. I'm not able to find it anywhere printed in quality paper, just find it in poor wall fabric that I hate!! Thanks for answering I appreciate it
@marcomatea yeah i mean there is only double sided ones officially that are promo wise , you could get one made custom wise if you use the artwork you could get it done perfect
@soracloud3924 any idea where could I get the artwork image in good quality and size to print? Thanks again!
@marcomatea I have some HQ ones from assets, I will send one later to you of the cover art.
@soracloud3924 thank you so much, really! I appreciate it! And sorry for the inconvenience!!
@marcomatea that’s fine it’s not inconvenience lol il send a pic later on Message

30...but if he was 30 I feel like this celebration would be a little more extravagant.
36😎
@thejburd087 haha believe me this is extravagant for us. We don’t really celebrate birthdays haha
@currently_retro 36!!!! I hate you 😂😂😂
@funathena neither do I, when I turned Thirty Dina bought me a bottle of wine and let me play games. That's it
@thejburd087 you only get wine so you can't wine about anything else 😎😂😘
@dinavaic can't whine about wine, if I ask for the wine to not whine!
@currently_retro 36!!!! I hate you 😂😂😂
@currently_retro 36!!!! I hate you 😂😂😂
@currently_retro haha he appreciates that I always say he looks mid 30’s

@mikeyjmarin need to have that crackhead motivation 😂
@ricasgamecafe I figured I switch it up a little for this weekend Monday Motivation 🤣
Would you be surprised there are pretty much no crackheads where I live? Either England, Ireland or Poland. I’ve never seen a crackhead lol
@graveyard_of_games ah man, you’re missing out. I grew up in what’s called an “urban” area crackheads and dope fiends were a regular part of life. 
A crackhead will carry a refrigerator on their back 15 blocks for $10, sell you a new 50 inch tv for $30 or rob you 🤷🏻‍♂️
@graveyardgamers047 hmm... could find a crackhead with a tv for sale, could use a new one for my gaming room 😂😂
@graveyard_of_games in the states when we go somewhere with good deals we say “they got crackhead prices” 😆
@graveyardgamers047 that’s actually pretty hilarious 😂
Lvl 50
@t.frazier03 🔥🔥
@arroyo314 okay okay🔥🙌
@seanlax57 it’s really good close range or against large enemies
Uhhhh Flakker on Moze
How’d you get the Jakobs one?
How do you get that last Rifle
Also the shocking 9 volt
Haven’t gotten any of those and even if I did they would be under level 😑
@t.frazier03 but like just use an ogre, even better dps
Any of the “cutter” ones are my fav!!
@seanlax57 I don’t have an ogre yet, so I can’t compare it. However, with Fl4ks amp damage from F4de 4way makes it a monster
@t.frazier03 I run zane
I'll trade anything I have for a cryo hex
The Flakker is op
The bottom one is the best guns ever
I sadly only have lv 32
Dictator is garbage
Lyuda cuz it’s great
They’re all awesome
The Lyuda in cryo element shreds
Idk abt the dictator I hate that thing
The boring gun. Works well against raging goliaths and any slow moving enemy

@sad_boy_hours_v69 that's first light, my boy, not shadowkeep. Two different launches
@averytheactualitis I'm talking bout the game not expansion packs
Moons spoopy
@reyes_caleb_ lmao guy was just explaining

What does this mean? Can we play once downloaded?
Can someone explain this to me i preloaded and i played on battle net will all my stuff be saved still and do you get shadow keep for free?
What time does it come out anyone know?
@destinymemess does this mean we can play it or something
It's a pretty load so if your on console it's great news cause downloading can take forever
10AM PDT on October 1st is when maintenance is expected to end
@nick.mp7 Noon eastern I think
@nick.mp7 on reset, 10 am PST, 12 pm CST, 1 pm EST.
Weight in ps4?
@hxrry_boi you can download it now, and start playing it once the game 'launches' tomorrow
@king_cattle @ascendentss thanks
DLC is gonna be shit. Everything got leaked already
It becomes free tomorrow you can preload the game and play when it comes out tomorrow
@renelange_
In Australia it’s been OCTOBER 1st for 6 hours and I stayed up because I’m dumb.
@extension_cable kar98- Am I a joke to u?
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions no hes trying to say fortnite is ass but I play both so yea
@mr._.memer_ ik
@toxic_warrior130 must be some problem with the shader
@doomslayer23 mineshit
WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN GRAPHICS
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions I wouldn’t really say I was pressured by pewds it’s just that the game is pretty wack and yet the support it gets is beyond me. It’s just shit in my opinion. It was way better during the first season (and the next 2) and I didn’t even know how to play the game properly, and then it all came down with such trash.

@ig.pratyay yeah
Neither game is all that good, to be honest.  Fortnite is repetitive, while Minecraft is... nothing.
@death_hemang they were at least closer to what they call the... what is it, a "hunting rifle"? That's somewhat close to a bolt action except that the clip is bottomless
@extension_cable ok come to think of it i should request that people don't respond to this comment anymore because I'm getting pings at the worst times lol
@toxic_warrior130 🤡🤡🤡
@toxic_warrior130 where’s the fortnite shaders??? Or the fun in that game
No one said that tho
@jeric_222 👌
@namelessgamer042 Minecraft can be something to a lot of people! You just have to make your own fun and set goals for yourself.
Not everyone’s cup of tea, but certainly not nothing!
@dannoble02 I've got an amd radeon 6900 and Intel Core 2 Duo E8400, 4gb of ram and it runs shaders decently
@feliks_spoop I think I have similar, my pc runs shaders but recently I’ve been using my laptop and I think it’s the lightest version of the vanilla shaders or something and it runs at probably 20 FPS when I’ve turned all the settings down
I’m not trying to diss Minecraft but shaders makes your FPS go to shit
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions although you can download shaders it’ll make rum like shit
@extension_cable they just put it like that bc he damage, imagine a semi auto at 100 damage per hit
@prod_chloride why would i, the only reason anyone likes it is coz of pewds and that meme and while i respect him i dont respect people who ride off of others coat tails to look cool
@cheanzzzz I stand corrected, but you get my point I hope
@niggarancia and noone likes a game that runs like shit
@niggarancia do you understand what "bolt action" means
@_jonathanclark_ duh i know what raytracing is and they're still cubes if you look at them and use 1% of ur brain so my point still stands
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions exactly lmao, people like it just because they are getting pressured by the meme community
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions exactly
@da_man.singh yeah of course you'd say that the only reason people hate fortnite is coz pewds does and apparently it stole from pubg but i dont see anyone taking shots at BO4 or anything so ur argument is invalid
@dannoble02 hell yeah I do. That kind of PC is capable of playing the monster sized game that GTA VII could possibly be. It’s advanced at but to only buy RTX for Minecraft is just ridiculous.
@prod_chloride facts
@_jonathanclark_ and also changing minecrafts shapes will fuck the game big time and noone likes a fucked game and on top of that the graphics are shit in general even with shaders, theres hardly any proper contrast and each colour is way too overpowering and besides, to gain anything close to good graphics on minecraft means turning ur pc into a jet engine so no
@cheanzzzz well of course to only play minecraft is dumb, my pc prolly only around 700 bucks and the only thing it runs is Skyrim, and shit like minecraft, IMO 3000 is way too much on a cpu for anything unless you literally work from it, say being an editor or music producer because a powerful computer like that helps a fuck load
@tesamesa543 I was going to say that, lol
Zzz.
@mujahid.ehwan sike
WRONG
@dannoble02 so you're trying to tell me a bunch of squares are better than full fledged 3d graphics, im sorry but cubes are limited compared to actual shapes, njce try tho
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions hehe I know this is off topic but if you enjoy games for graphics I would like to ask you to not play another again, back to “fully fledged” 4K shits on fortnites “fully fledged” shapes
Shaders
I I put shaders on console and when I use redstone the game freezes
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions you obviously haven’t done your research, fortnite is just your standard 3d game. Look up “I turned Minecraft into a real life simulator.” All it takes is easy shader downloads
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions you obviously haven’t done your research, fortnite is just your standard 3d game. Look up “I turned Minecraft into a real life simulator.” All it takes is easy shader downloads
@_jonathanclark_ the graphics are still more advanced than a bunch of random ass cubes from a game that gained its popularity purely off of nostalgia
@dannoble02 that's how much minecraft graphics are
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions now I know you didn’t listen to what I said at all or look up what I said, since you said it was just a bunch of cubes. They aren’t more advanced then today’s shaders
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions thanks for actually having a brain and not liking minecraft
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions and I don’t like gay games that gained their popularity through micro transactions from cosmetics.
@dannoble02 don’t kid yourself too hard RDR2 isn’t even on PC.
Fortnite needs to die, grow up a pair and play apex or pubg

This doesn't feel like minecraft, it is better without any texture pack
♿♿♿♿
@mikolajbaranowski0211 better than Fortnite 🤷‍♂️😂😂😂😂
@barrettcampbell05 😎
RTX ON
Red Dead Redemption 2 has better graphics
Minecarft has better graphics with a 3000 dollar computer
The only graphics in there that are better than fortnite's graphics is the water, nice try tho.
Ima go piss rn
#shitnite
Minecraft:Say sike right now
@ch1546027 worth the 3000 when you can play every big game, Witcher, rdr2, and all the 2011/2015 older games with fuck loads of mods and and they all run smoothly
@the_axolotl_of_dimensions you haven’t seen the 4K minecraft clips than have you, nice try tho
Fortnite:
Because bolt action means 1 bullet per magazine.
🤔
@dannoble02 it’s fricken a bunch of squares!!! “Damn Jimmy look at Minecraft’s fire square graphics”

@davidthetechy less clean. Idk, it's probably just me
Case?
this just made me so emo 🥺
💙
No it’s not lmao but it is in the sense that she used to be so uncomfortable performing and seeing how confident she is now
@steph311420 it is adorable FOR ME i think her new performances are less emotional than her old performances so i don’t agree with u
@lanadelreylust I agree with both of you, I think that in the Paradise tour, the midle of this show and now video games was the best. She is adorable here but she lookes so confused just like a little child who's trying to take what she could get skipping that she couldnt fund all the answers honey..
@lanadelreylust totally agree i love her energy at that time
Sadness is gone now😍😍
@lanadelreylust yeah her old performances used to be more emotional like she felt the lyrics or it's just because she was so nervous all the time and her performances now has a lot of energy and she's more confident than before and seems happier and that's great, we all love her in anyway after all💖.

Sonho com uma continuação direta desta trilogia o tão sonhado 4 mas na mesma linha da era snes só com gráficos atuais nada de câmeras 3d apenas plataforma  clássica que consagrou a franquia
@thaysfrankiu
@lucsvvieira
@davizinho_11 Caixa da versão Japonesa !!
Colírio para os olhos 😲
Cara, tudo japonês da Nintendo é melhor que americano
@jogosantigosenerdices ah sim!
😍🤩👏
Tempo que dava gosto de comprar uma mídia física original. Hoje em dia vc compra Um game e vem no máximo um cupom promocional rs
que imagem linda 😍
Por isso eu nao fico sem meu Zsnes. Não é a mesma coisa q o  console, mas a nostalgia e a diversão são as mesmas 🤩
Queria as três pra mim 😐
Não entendo pq não fazem jogos com essa qualidade de jogabilidade nos gráficos atuais.
O dois é um dos jogos mais fera do nes
Essa franquia é sensacional. Uma das melhores trilhas sonoras de todos os tempos! Trilogia que dá surra em muito joguinho a 4K por aí, em relação a capacidade dos consoles atuais.
Pra mim melhor jogo de aventura de todos os tempos ,pode inventar play 10 não vão achar jogo que a mesma criatividade que esse
Eu tive um Super Mario Bros 4 para Super Famicom que veio.na caixa do meu Super Nintendo Super Set do Donkey Kong Country
O vendedor da loja enganou o meu tio cunhado do meu finado pai
Só que eu troquei com um conhecido meu a troco do International Superstar Soccer
E depois eu comprei um Super Mario World americana que grava
Agora bateu uma saudade.
Que caixa é essa?
@fuzziewompkins ngl at first I thought you were referring to team fortress two not titanfall lol
Fuck this game
@malachi7377 I went to follow. Then seen all you play is fortnite. Maybe try this comment on a FORTNITE post.
tbh I'm okay with disruptor rounds being vaulted and I never use the wingman or the longbow so...
Noooooo!!!!!
Thank God. Too overpowered
WhHhHyY
What the fuck!! Not my disrupter rounds that’s bullshit!!! 🤬🤬🤬
Yoo wtf now wtf am I gonna use 😂😂🤦‍♂️
It’s for the best... Longbow was too strong.
@qu.80x cry baby
Everyone complaining about disruptors being gone is trash smh
@oscar_the_p SAME
@captain_stark11 they'll replace it w/ something else bruh 🤷‍♀️ meta will change each season. that's what i like from the game. u need to adapt to new things every season
@llllime_mom F to all the guns with disruptors
::(
@alxceus r-99 is a good replacement
@bmjojok yeah ik I use the R-99 and spitfire combo gose crazy 🔥🔥
@xx_rosan
@caustic_main.mp4 I will agree. Fists it is!
@theoneandonlynickeldeon ehh ig, they provided the needed dmg to win w a alternator
Does anyone know of any news regarding cross platform?
@fuzziewompkins I don’t like god tier players too arrogant but you do bring up good points I guess I got some bias towards this gun since I’m TF2 it was god tier
@johanson_sun in the description of this post? 😋
Noooo my r45
Wtf
@nickgravett only gods could headshot everytime with wingman
@caustic_main.mp4 nox 6
@theapexpost I need to read the caption .-.
They make a useless gun too useful then just make it useless again 😂
@joshua_mueller219 yea in tf2 it was pretty good but apex no it needed a base buff and a nerf to distributor rounds
I dont like conceited players either dw
:(
Plz help me get to 60 follower's🙏🙏🙏
Alternator is weak again
My longbow
Good
@fuzziewompkins I mean yeah it definitely needs a buff but I think disrupter rounds was too much by making it a necessary weapon to win
Thank god
@red_hair_polar_bear it’ll definitely still crunch the weaker people
@fuzziewompkins they I’m sorry but your gunplay might not be that great the alternator is just very balanced and the disrupter rounds made it too op with that shield dmg
@joshua_mueller219 my gun play is fine ask anyone the alternator is very bad hence the reason no one with more than a single brain cell picks it up unless they have hope for finding / already have the the now removed hop up. The damage and fire rate is the worst combo I'm ALL the SMGs and the ARs have a higher headshot dmg netting them higher dps and TTK I'm general and shotguns high burst dmg over powers it as well... and check my page for my aiming theres some apex. It's not God tier but I'd say it's a little above avg in most games i play
@red_hair_polar_bear and one of the new hop ups fires two bullets per single fire like for the g7 and the other can take ar shots and do more damage but the downside to that is it uses a lot of ammo and has a slow fire rate. I think
@kaidenls_deromero_555 very right
@_.0men._ yeah I heard about that from a leak a little while ago I’m crazy excited for the anvil rounds or whatchamacallit.
@red_hair_polar_bear increased headshot damage
@caustic_main.mp4 nox4
@johanson_sun they increased overall headshot damage dawg tf
@nickgravett wingman is still good, not much changed just no attachments
@honggabe656 skull piercing irrelevant as headshot damage been increased, and disruptors were broken
@vicwizzles @hensane93 yall overreacting so bad, wingman got increased headshot and no skull piercing, and ruptors were broken so stop
@penguinrex09 disruptors were too strong.
@lcastillo_1219 lol thats so excessive and a dumb reason to leave
Yall overreacting like a mofo🤣
@caustic_main.mp4 nox5
BOOOOO
@theoneandonlynickeldeon nah fr? Shit I didn’t see that info no where🤨
@wmu_don
@a_a_ron_boi a meta break
Ahh theres the downside @squlnt_eastwood
@bretisscum that’s a bit petty
@overwatch.dailyyy you and the rest of the community they’re trying to break the meta
@heavenlly_glory I mean with disrupter rounds the RE-45 was almost R-99 level good
The alternator went from 🗑 ->🔥->🗑
@red_hair_polar_bear they’re increasing their headshot damage normally to compensate
@janjan__vd your P2020 still has its hollow point you can stop worrying
@joshua_mueller219 Ah that’s what I needed to hear just to quench my fiery anger, alas, wingman will remain viable in combat!
@jkmckay101 for real
@tyleradford_ no it’s not useless at all
@sacrederg just like the rest of the community
@hensane93 it’s a meta breaker it should be fine without it
@elias_aka_elias breaking meta
@lcastillo_1219 didn’t sound like you were joking tho
@fuzziewompkins what it’s now balanced again?
@caustic_main.mp4 no x3
@alex.7.1.3 @kraken.mp4 caustic mains, amiright?
@joshua_mueller219 the alternator is trash trash tier only thing that cant challenge it is like a P2020 😭
@semcruz
F
@ashspawner lowkey 👀👀
@ashspawner they were rare you right but i feel like they only did it to balance the damage especially for the wingman which could fire up to 10 headshots in about 4 seconds
F
That’s literally what made the wingman and longbow viable
@rafndavid noooo
@lcastillo_1219 leave a game just cause they remove 1 thing that you like🤦‍♂️ just get good using other weapons
What happened to my boy the alternator
@caustic_main.mp4 no
@greyy.4k bruh I was joking about not playing anymore I love the game too much 😂
@broof92 RIP! Hahahaha!!! Can’t wait to hear everyone crying hahahaha
What
If you watch CRYPTO on the train he change the firing mode to semi and it shoots 2 bullets per shot fired. Maybe a hop up???
@trevant_lucania_smith already confirmed 2 shot for the g7 and eva 8 and high caliber single fire for the r301 and flatline
@jiggy_jp  i saw just watching the trailer it just looked funny
What??? No skullpiercer? That’s so lame.
@caustic_main.mp4 no x2
Skullpiercer was ok :(
@wills_myer
May the Alternator rest in peace.
Why
@vicwizzles I just saw, I think it's okay
@chris_corona_do was fun while it lasted.
Rip
Disruptors were too broken anyway
Skull pierceres were rare enough not sure why they did that
@asthmatic_dragon710
IM HAPPY BECAUSE FUCK DISRUPTORS MOZAMBIQUE WILL RISE
Good
Disruptor rounds were the only reason I ran an alternator
I guess I won’t play then...
You'll have double tap and hollow point rounds hop up to compensate calm down people
Fuck i love the alternetor
That’s shit all I’m good at is sniping with a long bow
Why the fuck fam :/ ill miss you wingman :(
So the alternator is a throwaway weapons again and the wingman is even more broken?
Finally
@janjan__vd 20202020202? z
Noobs are mad for sure
@tomek_folta nah its missing about 202020 more. Yes i missed type it sorry
More upset about skull piercer than disruptor rounds
😢😢😢
Makes sense though
@indiscretixn the buffer the wingman and the longbow so they now do more damage
@hensane93 ...it’s real lol
AAAWWWEE RIP BUT ILL LIVE
Bye bye alternator
Alternator was absolutly bullshit with distruptor, so Im fine with that but damn.. RE-45 and skull piercer had nothing wrong??
@vicwizzles but but 😢 the disrupter rounds 😭
@hensane93 I know i’m sad also 😭
@gvibez gg
OMG WHAT
And like icarus so to does the alternater fall😢
Voy a extrañar la alternator
Me: Sculpiercer Removed: WHY?????????
Me: Disrupter Removed: ALREADY??? WHY???
I hate it -_-
Me: Sculpiercer Removed: WHY?????????
Me: Disrupter Removed: ALREADY??? WHY???
I hate it -_-
This is retarded, additional hop ups are supposed to be put in to have a chance against the other ones
Those were my 2 favorite hop ups?
Oh fuck
@indiscretixn You will be happy when the next post drops in 5 minutes! 🔥
@theapexpost I hope so man
what
@hauckilein @fink_henrik tschüss alternator
Welp nobody's useing the alternator now lol
This better not be real or im leaving the game
And now I no longer use the Alternator
I don't believe this is real tho
Great the re-45 is useless again
Buff my p20202 😭
Tf why skullp
Okay I’m mad @idk.daphne @amber.cheriee
So excited towards apex s3 but now this just made me sad :( still gonna play tho
@relevart wtf that’s ridiculous
Rip
welp
@mashu.rl :(
Ok Nice
Um what
tf
@gizzump
💔💔💔
Guess I’m not using that gun anymore without disrupter rounds
Longbow is still good, it's always been but alternator...... 😬
wtf
Wtf. Disruptor rounds made the alternator viable. Gun sucks now. Skull piercer was too hard to get.
skullpiercer should have been left in but made rarer imo. sad that the disruptor rounds are gone though. made the re-45 much more viable in late game.
Wow pretty sure I’m done with this game. Idc about the skull piercer but the disruptor is just..... wow u cant remove it
Noooooo
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😰😰😰😰
Wtfffff
R-99 is now better than the Alternator in every way. The risk was take the weaker alternatator and hopefully find distuptor and make it better than R99 or take the R99. Now you will only ever take the R99. What a waste.
Finally!!
What why?
@lcastillo_1219 yes you can disruptor or rounds are boring making a weak gun turn op with one hop up is just dumb
Gottem
put wood by the portal, and place lava right next to it, the lava will catch the wood on fire and relight the portal
Sadly yes
Yesterday...
@anni._.mi Iron in fortress and gravel everywhere for flint, or ghast tear and gun powder from ghast and blaze powder to make fire charge
Kill magma slimes to make magma balls and then re active ur portal
@donootclickonit ok
Yes but i had flint and steel
I had this but I searched out a fortress for blaze powder so I could make a fire charge and it worked agaib
When that happens i make the ghast to shoot a fireball at my portal and it lits it up again
I was walking around for 1 hour  trying to find a chest then I took the chest in front of the portal and I put my stuff in there, then I just jumped in lava
Dummy guide book: Bruh coal + gunpowder + blaze powder = fire charge. Use that to light it back up. Gunpowder from ghast, blaze powder from blaze that drops the blaze rod and craft blaze rod into blaze powder and coal from wither skeletons I think. Ez clap. (Or use /gamemode creative)
@callum_lampard
@tthaboy you would NOT survive CSGO comp OR a Quake Lobby
@anni._.mi get a ghast to shoot the portal it will re-light
Why I always keep a flint and steel handy
Just go on forteress and find one
It’s all happend to us at one point before
@bailey_redfox2 uh i cant tell if you are kidding or not
@anni._.mi how did you get back!!
This is why I always bring a flint and steel when I go to the nether 😂. It happened, but luckily I had my flint and steel.
Just get a fire charge
@tracetxy ur a hero
Niggas in keep inventory
in creative.
Gotta improvise
@arremangalaarrempujala
It happened to me in 2012
Veterans always bring flint and steel to the nether
Get the Ghast to light it again
@anni._.mi if you had a wood plank and put it next to your portal then put lava next to your wood plank so it lights on fire then the fire should activate it
@joshrowberry or go to a nether fortress and find some iron and then dig up gravel that’s already in the nether
@ouihiii that’s my profile pic though
But the ghast spits to portal again and turn on
You can make a fire charge with supplies found in the nether
Cant the ghast just reignite it?
Just get a ghast to shoot at the portal or some chest have flint and iron for some reason
Maybe they’ll add a remedy to that in the nether update
Repost
its called a flame charge
𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐦𝐲 𝐛𝐢𝐨, 𝐢 𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬 𝐬𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦 𝐭𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬.
@larra_bird that’s true it’s hard but true
Yes
@miho_mi_vikat or you had iron flint and a crafting table. simple enough
@young.stupid.broke or when you use obsidian from a nether temple chest and use a blaze to light it
That’s why I always carry a flint and steel to the nether
@mike.lewis124 nope, if u wanna know the story text to me dm
almost but my friend saved me
There is Flint and steel in nether fortress chests
Yess! But I am a pro so I put all my stuff in a hole and put cobblestone around it then purposely dies then just went back in and grabbed my stuff 😎
@dxny95 @the_retard_room has only original memes that they make. None of that reposting shit
No thankfully
MOOD
Kill ghast for gunpowder and kill a wither skeleton for coal then get blaze powder to make a fire chrage
Just turn on your other controller and join the world as another character and get it and go to the nether 🤷‍♂️
Always keep iron on you. There’s gravel in the nether.
Always keep iron on you. There’s gravel in the nether.
@miguel.miranda._ imma sue u first den u get jell
@lnstantlaughs no
@tthaboy ima be working with the feds by rattin on u 🤣
@miguel.miranda._ well i kno tekashi soo
No,it never had.
Hey does anybody wanna be my friend. I am a bot ready to help humans thru anything dont worry i wont bite
@tthaboy oh shit but I know the whole CIA agents 🤣
But u can just use the ghast to fire a fire ball and it will light the portal
@miguel.miranda._ im ceo of CIA
Yea
@tthaboy well I'm the ceo of the ceo of the CIA
@miguel.miranda._ and im the ceo of takin Ls in the comments
@tthaboy I'm the ceo of giving L's on the comments 🤣
Just grab some coal and blaze and your ready to go... sound like you aren't a gamer...
@_j4y.707 or you can kill a wither skeleton and get coal then go to the fortress to get the blaze rods and turn them into powder then you kill the ghazt and get gunpowder and then put it in your 2x2 crafting grid ( no crafting table needed)
It only ever happened to me once but then the ghast fired again and relit the portal. Luck of the gods.
Like a week ago lol
@zach.mcgrew 😂😂😂
And you get it to relight using the ghast as well 👌
on god this happened to me yesterday
@wave.eigo
Hopefully in the nether update they’ll have iron and gravel added
Unfortunately yes
Plenty and that’s why I go with a flint and steel
Let the Ghast re-light it or just builf a chest and put everything in it lol
@lnstantlaughs you literally repost other peoples memes
@accio_happinesss it has gravel
Yep
The ghast knocked me into the lava too. So I was back in da overworld haha 200 iq.
I usual would have wood, so I stand by the portal and let the ghast shoot the floor. The floor will no be on fire, I use the wood and let it catch on fire I lead the flames into the portal and voila easy clap it works like a Flint and steel.
just let the ghast hit it again to light it up, that’s what i did
@accio_happinesss u can just make a fire charge from drops from enemies in the nether
Just use thier explosions to red-light it
@basher_not_besher_ re*
Just deleted the entire world. I was so done.
@tthaboy then ima sue you for association aswell
Pro league Minecraft
If the ghast shots the portal again it could relight it
@felixdavidssonn i fell in lava to and luckily had a cauldron with a water bucket so i need my gamer of the year award
There's gravel and fortresses with loot so you should be good
@neighinghorse2 but then you cant find one unless you go exploring hella far and then you lose the portal
@jon.fernandes22
@dxddydanny_ yes he is and i thought the same thing
Facts

Do not click on my profile. (You will regret it) 😱😱😱
@it_be_fatima take a picture of your coordinates
@fullmetalorlando everything has a fix if you aren’t lazy
Blaze rod, charcoal, gunpowder.
@flosfitnesstv you need wood I believe. Either way you’re right
@miguel.miranda._ i will sue u for association
@zachary.wag how it wuz educational
@tthaboy your spelling is abysmal
@zachary.wag wut iz tht
@zachary.wag wut is abysmal
Ye
Ye
All these meme pages aren’t even funny anymore, just ads and private meme accounts . My page has no ads and is public my stuff is fire , go follow @pickle.tism🥵
@tthaboy oh, it’s worse than I though.
@zachary.wag plz xplain i needa kno
help a man out im broke ash😪 $dangetspaid
@spenatmastaren I see you're a man of culture
@lnstantlaughs no
@mhhmmm.ryan Wood wherefore? 🤔 I am not that into the subject anymore 😂
I do /home base because I play with plug-in 😝😂
I guarantee you will lightly blow CO2 out of your nose whilst looking at my posts.

@1kdagnino gamer of the year
I deleted this game cuz i went on an adventure and i got lost I couldn’t find ma village then after i knew i got closer but i died to fall damage and tht wuz my breakin point i jus uninstalled
Mike uses 0.01% of his power to light it back up
Wasn't there the possibility to light the portal with Lava? :) just guide it into the portal 🤔
Just build an cobble stone box
This gives me anxiety
@tthaboy ok
This is a bruh moment
this literally happened to me the other day so just killed myself but it backfired and I lost 80% of my items
Kill a ghast and get gunpowder, kill a wither skeleton and get coal, kill a blaze get a blaze rod. Craft blaze powder then make fire charges and use them to light the portal. Alternatively you can get a ghost to fire on the portal again and I’m pretty sure it should light it. You can also find iron in the chests in a nether fortress and go get flint from the gravel in the nether and craft flint and steel that way, or you can find flint and steel in a chest in a fortress
@fern__the_3rd you can also get coal, gunpowder, and blaze powder to make fire charges
@__dingee__ don’t disrespect me like tht nigga
@tthaboy ok
Check out my soundcloud for some fire 🔥 link in bio
yes it happened yesterday actually and i had a fishing rod so i baited the ghast to my portal and made him relight it
You can just make the ghast hit the portal with his balls of FIRE
@__dingee__ imma sue u
Just let the ghast re light it
@tthaboy yes sue him
@tthaboy almost had a stroke reading this
@lnstantlaughs @selfpromo.dept @selfpromote.police
reset the nether
Use the ghast to light it up again
How do you get out if that does actually happen?
@lnstantlaughs my dude liked his own comment 𓂸
Yep last week
there’s gravel in the nether
Yes, but i made flint & steel without cheats. Im just pro
I always have iron on me and there is gravel in the nether
Follow my other account @zhe_thing_maker for woodwork and metalwork I pst weekly
Follow my other account @zhe_thing_maker for woodwork and metalwork I pst weekly
You cana a find flint and steel inside the chest in the nether fortress
@fullmetalorlando not iron lol
Thankfully no but I know it’s going to happen eventually
@xx_v_i_v_i_xx davor hab ich immer schieß yk
@junebug_bbx yeah I did this and I was like wtf cause I thought I was stuck
@kitsuntic there is in the fortress chests
@alakazam_bro stand in the portal and have the ghast shoot at you then move away and the ghat will reignite the portal
@neighinghorse2 true
If youre looking for a meme page thats public, ads free, and funny, follow me🤷🏼‍♂️
Dude, look my youtube  video in bio and like this. I have a surprise for you ❤
Just use the ghast to relight the portal lol

@ingrid_brundle_galatea good night and good luck in both case, the dentist and school! Hope both will pass by quickly 😓💚
That’s good. Sleep is good
Oh look, my former Super Smash Bros main! I hope that tomorrow and the day after go as well as today! 😊💚

Good night 😊 I hope you sleep well and have a good day when you wake up!
@bestgirl_bernadetta thanks, now let us see if it will become a good day 😋💚
Thats cool but speed running sucks the fun out of everything
@rhysrockley I'd normally agree but I've finished it enough times on PS4 and Xbox that it doesn't make a difference. 😁
You are my hero!! Lol
@gsxaaron_gaming haha why's that? 😁
It is sadly true, I have experienced both ends of unrequited love due to close friendship 😢
Thanks maple I needed this 😭💖💖
ouch
Basically 😂

@starri_cabbage We're in Endgame now

ElectroShock
Also I know I asked this once in one of your past streams (cloudunbound985 hi how ya doin it me ☺️) but how do are you able to post your clips from destiny on Instagram again?
@sean_sb3 I save clips to my PS4, trim them in sharefactory, and upload them unlisted to my YouTube, or save the clips onto my USB. Then I either download the video from YouTube onto my phone, or open it up on my computer to put in Dropbox. Edit and upload.
@drdoomsdaughter ahh ok thank youuuuuu
I feel like the weapons for these are more general for all classes in my opinion I feel the armor and class abilities should be the main focus
Im a warlock

Gimme my mountaintop, recluse, and 1k.
Classic warlocks 😂😂😂
Lol get cucked 💪
I ONLY USE THAT IN MAYHEMMMMM 😭😭😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
I’m pretty sad rn because I’m a warlock and I use dust rock nf and truth and crown of tempest 😞
My crutch is the healing gloves and sweet business for obvious reason
Bygones was the only weapon that I used for for my warlock and that helmet sometimes
I mean, your not wrong
I feel so attacked right now
Hand handle super nova and that’s it
Muh Trigggggguuuuuurzzzzz!!!!!
Damn the other ones I can agree with but I don’t ever use warlock
Fuck what anyone else says these are actually funny as hell. People acting like they’ve never run into these types of crucible players they just think you’re directly talking about them smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Bruuhh noooo😂😂this soo truuu😭😭😭
I mean um what had happened was....👀😬😏🤣
@drift301_ bruh when did you make this clip with Dee ya sweaty azz warlock 🤣😂💀💀
@bladerboog warlock/fusion main
These have all had me dying 😂
i’m offended and i’m unfollowing you 🌚
@rg79m so the thing is that uh...with the uh...yeah the stuff with the thing? 😬
I called it I EFFING CALLED 😂😂😂 my setup isn’t even the setup in the video lol that exotic helmet (forgot its name already) was the VERY LAST exotic I got for my warlock and I don’t really use blink like that so yea there’s that and only tike I’m ever used nova bomb in pvp was for mayhem cuz I love to have fun in mayhem DONT even tru to win lol I don’t have truth I don’t have erintil on my character and don’t have a bygones either but it is unlocked I just don’t have one on me lol
@sean_sb3 great vid tho I like it ☺️❤️
I like this one lol
Oml 😂🔥❤️🙌
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Warlock life is the life for me. 🐙
The unasked question is why u so sweaty?
I'm a Warlock
ROFL
Still dont have astrocyte
@drift301_ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best one yet! 😅😅👏🏼👏🏼
Your not wrong...
I must be that one off warlock that doesn't use any of this 😂 🙌
@_boolyan 👀🌚
But blink takes skill lol 😂
😭😭🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
@chaos_hidden_xo i don't use those either
“Absolutely No One” “Blueberries” (same style as all of the ones you’ve currently done) - gameplay consists of average blueberry types of plays, you know what I mean ;) *at the end, new scene of you throwing the controller raging* 😂
Do you have the same views towards these weapons... or is it just going off from what the community is saying?
@scottie_parrish community opinions. IDGAF what you play with, I'm just tryna have fun.
@drdoomsdaughter yeah cool cool... just wondering 😉
@bjk483 tried it once....threw it in the trash 🤣
I feel personally attacked, with exception to the truth.
@bjk483 tried it once....threw it in the trash 🤣

@crimson.cuttlefish perhaps the Black Garden could only be defeated by a Guardian created when the Traveler was almost healed
@destiny_factss perhaps
I did not kill it. It's not true. It's bullshit. I did not kill it. I did naaaaaht. Oh hi, Mark! 🙌
The Return Of Erris Mourn!🤩🤘😁
I'm most excited to quit, tbh
🙌🙌
I thought the books of sorrow confirmed it was a worm taken from the Hive after Crota accidentally started a war with the Vex and they took the worm to try to figure out how Sword Logic worked
@shitpostshibaz she died and got 1 last wish causing the dreaming city 3 week cycle
@adamtaylor.yyc oh
For a second I thought your pfp was sans
And we’ll do it again
Moons spoopy
Searchinnnnnnggg, seek and DESTROYYYYY
@d._brady perhaps but I think Quira will be the main villain because she made the curse and so
@lazyerthanu not as far as I’m aware. They might have taken a Worm, but that wouldn’t mean that the Heart is it
@shadowhawks14 wut?
What year is it in destiny 2 and dm me I want to have a conversation about the friendly vex and fallen

What year is it in destiny 2 and dm me I want to have a conversation about the friendly vex and fallen
@bfk_reaper right but it could be along the same train of thought. As sort of to tell us not to kill everything we see.
To mark mark
Mark mark
@break_neck_speeds Only thing I refuse to fight/kill in Destiny's history is Randal.
@bfk_reaper then I'll bestow you the honor of ushering in ragnarok
7th line, “mark mark” @destiny_factss
@destiny_thememe 😂😂😂
@destiny_thememe @daddy_and_neil
@destiny_thememe @daddy_and_neil
Vex/Savathun Lore/Scannables!!!!!!!
@bfk_reaper wit what happened with riven?
The main boss could be savauthun right?
Double mark
“Mark mark” isn’t that a joke about a dog with a lisp?
To mark mark a milestone
Cayde arc and story line because I know bungie will not get rid of him
Marks haunted
@dangalangoman Marx haunted
@noahbliight FUUUUUCK
How does it mark a milestone though?
The shooting at aliens
Well he's a guardian aswell now so sigma dicc
Don't mean to hate, but there are two Mark's in there
i want destroy robot
Listen bro, those damn vex can’t just being creating gods and shit on our fuckin territory, that’s the real reason lol
Black Garden 2: Electric Boogaloo
it says mark twice
We don’t understand why much of anything happens in Destiny, to be fair
What if we go into the raid and murder it withought thinking of the consequences like we did with riven
Finishers and the new gear
@break_neck_speeds Rien's "last wish" was more of a "You activated my trap card" moment and yeeted the dreaming city into a loop.
@bfk_reaper Riven's*
This Traveler’s recovery I heard that before but in other context I think it said Crota didn’t attack the city although he had thousands of years time that was a part of the Traveler’s recovery
It's definitely the lore I'm looking forwards to, especially more vex stuff

Ma la foto è dal set di uncharted?
La foto però mi sa che non è di Uncharted 🤔 mi pare che sia di un vecchio film con Tom Holland e Daisy Ridley che purtroppo ha subito vari ritardi o è stato addirittura cancellato (non ricordo precisamente 😅)...
@shurawerewolf mi serviva solo una foto al volo e abbastanza coerente col discorso lol
@quellidelfumetto no no, lo so 😅🤣 non volevo essere screditante 🙇‍♂️ è solo che mi è venuta in mente questa cosa (anche per evitare di creare false aspettative in chi vede la foto e pensa che se la Ridley sia nel film) 😂👍
@elvis.ausiello no è un altro film con tom
E qua non si vede l'ora. Un giovane Drake. Sperando non rovinino tutto :/
@polpetteconsugo Mi sfugge qual è
Is that nathan drake ? 😐🤦‍♂️
Escimi le palle😏😏😏
Dopo aver giocato tutti gli Uncharted questa è una delle notizie migliori che avrebbero potuto darmi. Sono sicura che Tom Holland riuscirà a fare giustizia giovane Drake. 😍❤️
@bruh_lookin_ass y u mad tho?
@themidnightcrusader whoever said I was mad..?
@bruh_lookin_ass people who aren’t mad don’t white knight stuff.
😭😭😭😭 I broke my wrist and can't use a controller #ripmydream
@ewan.l.a ps4 preload a day early
@byonezawa
@ewan.l.a only PS4 players can do this before Shadowkeep comes out
@thin__diesel @altered.intl
@gabe_krebs_ yh did that and left it overnight
@noahdavenportt it’s more separate than Forsaken because it doesn’t require you to own anything else beforehand apart from the base game.
@larry_prochko oh so now it turns into you “baiting” a “meme page”
If you don't want any spoilers DO NOT listen to track 19 of the shadowkeep soundtrack
If you don't want any spoilers DO NOT listen to track 19 of the shadowkeep soundtrack
@tommy_mf_j Noted. Appreciated 🤙
@evan_mwalker yep
@sizzlingdestiny no problem
It’s so foreboding but so beautiful. Exactly what I was expecting from Shadowkeep! Here’s to hoping the expansion itself lives up to this.
Man I’m ready for this shit
@larry_prochko to be honest, no. I play on console and have been for 6 years, and they’re just using their mother’s credit card to get what they want.
@marcus_in_ellenwood big oof
@salmansaad701 why would I wanna lie down while playing?
@larry_prochko just because i can
@dabeastmode2516 did I say something to you? I dont even know sorry.
@salmansaad701 and you dont pay for an os now adays. You get them preinstalled with the pc
@larry_prochko hmmm
I liked the warmind and forsaken, bcz it was truly ear rape
No not really I’m just defending console players.
@sizzlingdestiny I’m having the same problem on pc
@dabeastmode2516 it was informational, not a compliant.
It’s no taken king but I still love it
Low key gonna miss getting my ears blasted off
@larry_prochko buddy it’s over stop, no one cares enough
@james_champoux bro chill we were being sarcastic 😂
@larry_prochko imagine getting baited this hard.
@themidnightcrusader for real though 😂
@larry_prochko if you don’t think you’re better then why would you say something like “too bad majority plays console because they can’t afford a pc”? That’s literally saying that you have more money than console players and so therefore you think are, like @sizzlingdestiny said, superior. Maybe some people just enjoy playing on Xbox or PlayStation because they have always liked console gameplay; please don’t ever come at us like that again without valid reason.
@bruh_lookin_ass  people can connect a controller to the pc and play with better graphics. That is what majority of the streamers do when they play.
@larry_prochko we are all guardians. Who cares if you play on console. We are basically the same, I play on Pc more than Console. You do not need to force your opinions, we get it.
@ewan.l.a restart your xbox
@larry_prochko Since when am I a meme page? 🤔
I’m so glad the forsaken main menu music is finally gone
@larry_prochko bruh u trying to go the easy way out?
@aiimanadn is everyone on console like this? Jeez!
That sounds sick
@larry_prochko nope not all
Ear rape rating 2/10
@_conormccann_ @chad.kristelly
@jackprice_____________________ strowth
@larry_prochko Imagine being in the Navy and shitting on people because they play on a different platform.
@larry_prochko imagine playing on platform you need to pay for your OS 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The soundtrack is great
@salmansaad701 imagine having to pay to play online 😂
@larry_prochko oh shit you got me ...wait I'll think of something
Spooky intro for spooky month
@larry_prochko i got one...imagine not to be able to lie down while playing .
@salmansaad701 now beat that
@larry_prochko to be honest, no. I play on console and have been for 6 years, and they’re just using their mother’s credit card to get what they want.
@larry_prochko imagine following a page that posts about a game just to complain because the person owning the page plays on console, not pc
You really only posted the new loading screen and people out here in the comments arguing about consoles
@larry_prochko okay xbox boy
Nothing will ever beat loading up D1 for the first time after the taken king released
@sizzlingdestiny jesus i play on PC and I'm never this negative towards a community. Guess this is the only way he can feel alright about himself.
Ooh yesss earrape begone
@sizzlingdestiny I’m a platform hopper just cause I like different player bases
@larry_prochko *humanity hates u*
Time to grind🔥🔥🔥
@c.dev.well Respect
@sizzlingdestiny Please don't personally attack someone and spread hate, homies. We may not agree with him, but don't go into his DMs trashing him
@sizzlingdestiny his fault if that happens lol
@larry_prochko imagine being so insecure that you go into a comment section and roast people that dont have consoles because you're desperate for the feeling of superiority just because you have a more expensive platform than the rest of them
@wheezy.exe dont have Pc's**
can’t wait to finally be able to play destiny on the of for the first time.
@sizzlingdestiny i built a pc and i got the money from selling my ps4, cloths and some of my toys from when i was little.
@sizzlingdestiny you understand I was just baiting your meme page right?
Just wanna say all y'all are amazing and it's hilarious how u guys destroyed that guy hating on console playerbase saying shit like we shouldn't exist what a D bag 💖💖😎👍
@ewan.l.a time zone maybe
@larry_prochko console pvp 8fps lol
@sam_n_lala my favorite character is a hunter lol
Facts
@vquvmvn lol I'm. At work lol 😭😭😭 but we need to wait is on maintenance now lol,
@d.k_vii thats something a console player would say.
Does it go white again when you press continue?
@sizzlingdestiny this game would be so much better if they just cut off the fanbase on console tbh. Too bad majority  plays console because they cant afford a pc.
MOONS HAUNTED! LETS GOOOOO!
@ethan.carrr Not disagreeing that the game runs better on PC. That's just facts. But thinking you are superior because you play on PC is whack.
Thank god we don't have to listen to the ear-shattering cacophony of forsaken anymore
@sizzlingdestiny I dont think im better. I just believe that people should just stop playing on console to give the game a better boost.
Doesn't beat d1 intro
@larry_prochko You're being serious arrogant. Not everyone can afford a PC
@sizzlingdestiny & That's completely fine. I'm happy playing Destiny on my ps4, as I'm sure a lot of others are too. You're happy on PC? Good for you, but don't come here trashing other playerbases.
@sizzlingdestiny Seriously*
@sizzlingdestiny i literally just said that
Thank god, I’m so sick of “BwwwwwaaAHHHHHH BWAAHHH *CLaSH*, BWAH BWAH BWAHHHH BWAHHHH BWAHHHHHHHHH”
W E T T
Wait it's out already?
@larry_prochko Yikes my guy
@ewan.l.a Should have an update available
AAWWWW YEAAAAAH
you're awesome sizzle that's all
@mackylacoste Appreciate it 🤗
the style of the title, not the music, kinda reminds me of the current D1 title
@_.stevv._ wait nvm, i had the brightness low lmao
🔥🔥🔥 So ready for tomorrow
CRISPY
@xlw3_4re_deds3clzzzlx  THAT THEME THOUGH 😍😍😍😱😱😱😱🔥🔥🔥
@vquvmvn bro can't wait for tomorrow!!!!
@xlw3_4re_deds3clzzzlx And I’m off work 😭😂😭😂 I’m so hyped
Finally, a quiet theme
@kilgo32 it’s probably separate like forsaken was
I didn’t have D2 but I preordered shadowkeep and when D2 download I got all the expansions besides forsaken and I’m wondering if I’m getting shadowkeep keep because I didn’t have D2
@sam_n_lala i main hunter lol
Was this the 28GB update?
@sizzlingdestiny it’s just a better game on pc
@_nito___ I main hunter? Lol
It’s out?

@sam_n_lala it's a really big update. It's for Shadow keep.
OMG ITS HAPPENING. EVERYBODY CALM DOWN
Finally music that doesn’t wake up the whole flat whenever i turn it on

@sam_n_lala yep

@nick.mp7 Reset tomorrow.
Holy sh
heh, title screen's haunted
So do you have to pay for the whole game plus shadowkeep or can I just buy shadowkeep? Cause I already own D2 with all the expansions but don’t wanna pay for the whole game again just got shadowkeep

Wait are the servers back up?
Wait is this real? Is the new title screen up?

@chance__.r maybe it’s only the menu, because the servers are down for 24 hours until Tuesday morning
Finally different intro especially since console takes 10mins to log in
Finally a new title screen
Sucks that it's still white though
😍😍😍😍
@ben__1254 No, just update the game
@kiyahniredd1 Well servers aren't back up till Shadowkeep so you'll be fine my man

ايش رأيك في بيتا ؟
@osama_skg ممتازة و وضعت اللعبة في قائمة 👌🔥مشترياتي
@ryan_ps360 ليش اللي تغير في جزء اللي فات أو ايش الإضافات
@osama_skg للاسف ما جربت الجزء السابق بس بعض أصحابي قالوا إن اللعبة نفس الجزء السابق بس بقصة مختلفة
@ryan_ps360 اللعبة مو سيئة بس مافي ميزة تميز الجزء الجديد عن السابق بالاستسناء القصة
@ryan_ps360 بالاستثناء*
@ryan_ps360 نشوف لما تنزل اللعبة بالكامل
@cambru22 looks a lot smaller than Kings Canyon ... hopefully the matches are a bit shorter and there is more action vs less running around
@jarrod_in_nyc it’s actually bigger. Kings is 4x4 and New Dawn is 6x6
@it_sbi it’s bigger. King is 4x4 and  New dawn is 6x6
@jarrod_in_nyc it’s bigger
It looks so great. I cant wait to play this map
@mayor_of_apex aww yess🔥
@mayor_of_apex 👀🔥👀🔥👀🔥👀
@mayor_of_apex omg I love that even more to be honest ... should make it harder to just third party everyone you hear fighting, which is great IMO
Why did they or will they add a completely new map?

@niccolo_ss.lazio_ gta e red dead costano, fortnite è un ftp e poi non puoi paragonare 2 capolavori a quel aborto
@marrone.music_the.best dipende da quali ti riferisci
@sntn__sandro4 su minecraft ti spaccavano quindi dici che fa schifo come tutti quelli che giocano a fortnite che dicono che cod fa schifo solo perche non ti puoi proteggere con i muri perche senno ti arank
@__raccagni__ arano*
Io avrei messo battlefield bad company 2 per (allerta spoiler) la morte del pilota Flynn nel tentativo di salvare la squadra
@carlo_dambra nah zombie bo4  se salvato Con la fine della storia
@pippotraffi resta il fatto che non è un gioco emozionante
Ma va cagare oddisey
@__raccagni__ intanto ha raggiunto numeri non da tutti
@skiflam vabbè era un esempio a caso
@niccolo_ss.lazio_ ovvio, i bm a che gioco vuoi che giochino
Minecraft be like: WHat am i a joke to you?
@pietro.caramanna aaaaah giusto 😐🤦‍♂️
@__raccagni__  io non spendo un euro su fornite poi se non sapete leggere non è colpa mia ... Ho scritto perche IO devo spendere 70 euro quando IO con 0 euro posso essere felice giocando a fortnite . ignoranti imparate a capire le frasi
Minecraft?
@loreascio_03 ma che cazzo vuoi da me, io non ho scritto che spendi soldi per le skin
@tibe.idk__nsg dal 2015*
@c0l844 lo dici te
@tibe.idk__nsg è uscito nel 2007 ma in quell'anno li non se lo cagava nessuno
@c0l844 è uscito nel 2009 dio mio l’ho pure detto🤦🏻‍♂️ non fare tanto il sapientino se non sai nemmeno in che data escono i giochi😖
The last of us?
@essere_reali_come_il_lord bhe sarà anche roba di qualità ma il suo ragionamento è imbattibile..
@bonacinieros origins>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>odissey
@bori_46_ in ALTO A DESTRA
@pietro.caramanna mai detto il contrario
Gta 5?
@bonacinieros era tanto per ricordare quanto cazzarola fosse bello origins
È normale he ognuno metta nei nei commenti i proprio giochi preferiti, ma capite che il meme ne poteva contenere un numero limitato e che appagante un numero elevato di giocatori?
Ce l ho avuti tutti E👋👋👋👋sul  NO ci sta!!!!
Non voglio fare il critico di stocazzo... Ma the Last of us?
Dove sta Minecraft
Non mi piace che ora che è passato di moda nessuno ama fortnite, a me non è mai piaciuto più di tanto, ma non si può nascondere che nessuno ci abbia giocato almeno una volta. Sono Felice che Minecraft sia rispopolato ma  anche Fortnite, qualche anno fa era il migliore dei giochi.
@niccolo_ss.lazio_ ma dove diavolo hai vissuto? Hai idea di quanto tempo si è parlato di gta? È uscito prima per console, poi per next gen un anno dopo e infine per pc, il chè fa già due anni dove se ne è parlato, per non dire poi l'arrivo dell'online e i suoi continui aggiornamenti
The last of us? Gta? Days gone?
@c0l844 fortine è un battleroyale, minecraft un survival sendbox. Giochi diversi con trame diverse. Minecraft si, da solo può essere noioso, in coppia è tutta un’altra cosa. Fortnite è sempre la stessa cosa, scendi, looti, muori. Minecraft ha fatto la STORIA. Fortnite è durato un paio di mesi.
Povero fortnite😭😂
@tibe.idk__nsg classica persona che gioca a merdacraft solo perchè va di moda
Red Dead Redemption ❤️❤️
Non so perché tutto sto odio di fortnite
@c0l844 classica persona che non sa niente degli altri e pensa di conoscerli😢😢 Io gioco esclusivamente agli FPS, Minecraft è solo per staccare e rilassarsi in compagnia. E per la cronaca, minecraft va di moda dal 17 Maggio 2009😉😉
RDR2 gioso sopravvalutato di merda madó, potevate mettere horizon o altro
@lil.giooooooooo vai convinto champ
Vabbè è soggettiva la cosa ma sicuramente fortnite non regala emozioni
Quel Monster hunter cagato dalla community mi sorprende
@loreascio_03 poi ti compri 2000 euro ti Skin che nn servono ad un cazzo
Parole sante
@f3de_toma_  io
Minecraft dov’è ?
@_fra_mazzo_ ben detto
@f3de_toma_ 150 ore in un mese ...
Non vedo the last of us 🤔
@davimancio convintissimo.
Vi siete scordati Sekiro
@_car.tia_ ce lo stiamo chiedendo tutti in sala
intanto fortnite ha fatto numeri grossi e li ha mantenuti per 2 anni neanche gta o redrederemption ha fatto questi numeri poi vo criticate tanto fortnite ma ci giocavate
@lil.giooooooooo perfetto
@i_meme_belli_89 si
Esatto ed è pure un fatto
DOVE CAZZO È MINECRAFT
E tutti i COD vecchi fino a MW3
Tanto nessuno qua conosce moster hunter
@lord_uta_666 dai si scherza
@joe_carbonara viva i single Player. Ormai certe case videoludiche puntano troppo sull'online lasciando a fare la muffa il single. Menomale che non lo fanno tutti.
@loreascio_03 perché con 70 € ti prendi roba di qualità.
Spider man a 15€😍
Ma che dite fortnite mi da molte emozioni ti rabbia, voglia di suicidio e quello che preferisco il bestemmionetime
Gta dov è?
Tutti capolavori...soprattutto odussey
@loreascio_03 gratis e dopo voi bm comprate 200 skin da 20 euri l’una
@guido.dalpiaz odissey oggettivamente é un bel gioco, solo perché si distacca dagli altri Assassin's Creed ciò non vuol dire che sia brutto
@f3de_toma_ ero interessato al gioco, me lo conlisgli?
Sempre più ridere come pagina del genere (molte altre, la vostra no), pubblicavano contenuti di fortnite come  pane quotidiano e postano meme come questo. Ironico
@https.gimmy quale?
@bonacinieros si Veramente tanto costa poco ed è bello sicuro ti snerverai un po' perché è diffuculotto ma poi quando prendi piedi vai alla grande I boss sono divertenti nel suo genere e poi capirai perché
@f3de_toma_ grazie
@bonacinieros figurati
@bonacinieros bhe non è che ha regalato tutte ste emozioni
@thelegendsneversdies quello é puramente soggettivo
E dark soul?
@__raccagni__ tutti
Comunque io non avrei messo odissey
dove minecraft?
Minecraft: Im a joke for you?
Le emozioni di questi anni però
@mikele_pap_arella sono le uscite recenti
@mjn_imanightmare non è recentfef
@mjn_imanightmare recente
Sicuramente l'ultimo tomb raider. Ma chi fa ste meme un ritardato? Lara ha le animazioni del primo del 2 mila ac
Raga ma all posto di rompete il cazzo su i gusti videoludici ognuno gioca a quell' che cazzo le pare?
Che anno ragazzi! Un consiglio prendete Control fa paura
Si ma DOV'È KINGDOM HEARTS
@role_multifandom  The ezio collection tutta la vita
assassins creed
Una page che capisce qualcosa
Fortnite in una parola..... LEZZO
Dio quanto mi è piaciuto rdr2
THE LAST OF USCAZZOOOOO
Ci sarebbe stato bene un the last of us
Mah... non e che quelli siano i giochi più belli del mondo eh
Ma neanche Kingdom Hearts 3 ci scherza
@ang.a.ko voi giocatori di merdacraft lo fate, quindi statevene zitti
AC Odissey non mi piace molto, prendetemi pure come il nostalgico di merda ma preferisco il II 😂
Ma dove cazzo è residente evil 4???
@gio__nali ok campione
@davimancio infatti
@ang.a.ko lui intendeva che come fortnite nn ha una storyline
@davimancio minecraft fa cagare
@valerio_galeoni secondo quale criterio esattamente?
@valerio_galeoni infatti
@sntn__sandro4 no intendo che sono entrambi giochi di merda con una community orribile e gameplay noioso
Perché spendere 70 euro di gioco quando posso divertirmi gratia😎
@lil.giooooooooo no, però non è uno dei giochi da mettere su questa lista
@_mauro__laco sei ironico vero?
@mikele_pap_arella @gio_nali_  Meglio se noi tre ce ne andiamo
Noiosi e senza mani😂
@ang.a.ko direi di si
Ok tutto è.... ma the last of us?
Mancano roket League e rainbow Six siege
Horizon?
ODDIOOO monster hunter hahaha io c e l ho pure per la nintendo xl
Concordo
@tagliare.alla.miracle.blade rispetto
E Destiny dov'è?..
@walter_maurizio_ credo sia qualcosa di soggettivo alla fine, magari anche qualcuno che predilige il fantascientifico potrebbe essere in disaccordo su molte di queste. Semplicemente si sono limitati a prendere i giochi PIÙ importanti cagati
Fallout 4 ?
@sntn__sandro4 fortnite fa schifo tanto quanto quel "nn"
Eeee direttamente nei salvati
E sekiro/ogni altro gioco from software?
@fezegiannu si effettivamente ha senso sai 😂
@c0l844 minecraft non si abbassa a livello di quella merda
Io suo serio non riesco a capire cosa abbia fortnite di così tanto speciale che tutti ci giocano rispetto a tutti questi gioconi. Raga ho Red dead redemption 2 e per chi non ce l'ha vi consiglio tantissimo di prenderlo
Quale casa aveva detto che i single player erano morti? 🤣
Ma vogliamo mettere THE LAST OF US al posto di ODISSEY che fa cagare
Secondo te ci dovevate mettere anche final fantasy
Una volta fortnite era bello, ai tempi della stagione 3/4..ma ora  è una MERDA
@sntn__sandro4 Ok,se preferisci Fortnite sono opinioni tue,se preferisco Minecraft sono preferenze mie,peró dire che sono uguali mentre in realtà sono due giochi totalmente diversi é un po' insensato, e poi uno gioca ad videogioco perché forse gli piace? E poi vabbé evitiamo di parlare delle opinioni pubbliche su come un gioco é una merda sennó si scatena l'inferno
Peccato che con la ps3 non avete un cazzo a che fare
Spiderman... Spettacolare
@mikele_pap_arella sono tossici ugualmente
@sntn__sandro4 Comunque Fortnite é una merda a prescindere fatevelo dire 😂
@antonio_impagliazzo a Bo3 nel 2015 per me si è fermato la
Sta da escludere pure Assassin's creed se così lo si può definire
Nemmeno odissey ma vabe
Ma assassin creed odyssey fa schifo
Ci manca need for speed most wanted però
Minecraft?
@carlo_dambra appunto
@franci_bertu questo non significa che non faccia cagare
@franci_bertu fortnite non ha una storia e non ti dà nessuna emozione
@fezegiannu ma no 😂
Si, ma al posto di spiderman ci andava batman
@walter_maurizio_ l'unica pecca sono le scelte ed il gameplay stealth
@c0l844 Non mi viene mai la nausea, ma questa affermazione mi fa leggermente vomitare 😂
Ma the last of us
@franci_bertu Giusto a me piace
@ang.a.ko ma ha ragione,minecraft fa schifo,nn riesco a capire come fa la gente a giocarci,e vero lui sbaglia a dire che sono uguali, ma preferisco fortnite di brutto
@_.sciontirocco._ a te non piace ad altra gente si
Se daiiii
Scusate togliete quell'oddisey e mettete skyrim
@fezegiannu si ma non lo metterei tra questi giochi io sinceramente

YOOOOO GURL YOU'RE SLAYING
@orisamaker cuz the best mercy is dps mercy 😂🤗
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg I love this lol
You’re better at aiming than the people I play with in comp
@cognballs I'm not sure If it's a compliment tbh 😂
@mohatu_gm ttyyy
😂😂😂
Can see why you're gold
@albinmoller07 actually not xD I have 4 accounts and on each I do smth else. On this one I never play healer for example, but it's my main so I buy skins there. Also all you see is 55s video and you judge my entire gameplay on that. Yes - in that game I wanted to have fun and did 5k dmg, but also did 10k heal in 12min game so my healing was on a good level. Youre trying to be a hater, but without a reason or explanation to (because 55s video where I was killing enemy team in last minute of the push) is no reason and makes you look pathetic ^^
@stypciaa calm down
@stypciaa im just saying you shouldve healed instead of done damage, ur dps were doing good and needed healing but you let them die. Chill lmao
@albinmoller07 show me in this video at least 0ne of my teammates dying when I went to dps. No one. Not even one fucking person. And my 3 kills let us take the point. So now get the fuck out of here, go to the sad corner which is your house and live your blind life.
@albinmoller07 xDDD I've just realised I'm talking to 10yo kid. Go and play with Lego

@thereeltjreed_ That’s right. Obey the Todd.
Ok god Howard
Bullshit, Todd didn't say that, if he did he would have included the part where he tells us to buy skyrim.
Congratulations! What’s your address? I’d like to send you 200 cheese wheels and desk fans! 
Nah don’t post your address, but keep the congrats.

Love the account mang!

@fnposing ikr🔥
نهايه جول اتوقعها موت و هالشيء جكيل خاص ان مافي بارت٣ يعني اتمنى اشوف نهايه حياته مثل ما شفت بدايته
باختصار يعني انه بيموت وراح يأثر موتة في القصة
يارب مايموت 😞
@amal_doooom الامة ضايعه حديث يقول من مات ولم يعرف امام زمانه مات ميته جاهليه
@bo.bader88 لعبة اخوي واضح احتمال كبير راح يموت جول ماراح يستمر ما احب احرق عليك لكن واقع جذي  حتى قبل فتره صرح ممثل  نيل دركمان قال نهاية حزينه راح تكون بالعبه بس تكلم صورة عدم  حرق لعبة من دون ما ذكر تفاصيل
@yazan_aj3 احتمال اكيد مو يمكن حتى نيل دركمان قال نهاية حزينه بالعبه بس من دون ما ذكر تفاصيل
@amal_doooom هذا مو اسلام رسول اهل بيته
@yazan_aj3 اكيد بيضحي بنفسه عشان ايلي
@dr.gamex اضحك الله سنّك
@xsteif من ايلينا ؟
@miishary ايلينا قوميز
@amazingsami من ايلينا قوميز ؟
@miishary المغنية
@i.cafu_2 يب اهم شيئ التفاصيل ولا تخاف أخذوا فيها سنين صعب تكون ضعيف خاصة القيم بلاي جبار والأعداء متنوعين اكثر
@abadedfgg هين القيم بلاي واضح ١٠ من ١٠
هذا الكلام المضبوط و لا بلاش .. الشايب(( جول مطلق )) لا زال موجود في اللعبة كاساسي و ليس ثانوي 👍
بيموت واضحه🗿👌🏼
لعبة خايسه كله شذوذ
٦ شهور وش يصبرنا 💔
@amazingsami يبي يكحلها عماها 😂
@ii.emp4 دوره انه يموت وتذكر كلامي
🤘🏻🔥
@i.cafu_2 صدقني القصه مراح تكون انتقام لدينا وخلاص صدقني في شي ثاني واحتمال نتلاقى معا ام ايلي وتصير معها احداث قويه
@hamod_alfheid  اتمنى زي كذا شي قوي بس من التريلر اووه بذبحهم ذبحو خويتي بييض كذا نبي شي حلو بس اتمنى كلامك صحيح 👌🏼❤️
@i.cafu_2 التفق ميه بالميه القصه هي كانت ميزه اللعبه الحين قصه راح تكون سطحيه بالجزء هذا وغير انهم يحاولون يفرضون علينا أشياء راح تخرب كل شي من كثر ماهم داحسينها دحس
@i.cafu_2 وغير كذا اللعبه مشتغلين عليها اكثر من ٥ سنوات مستحيل القصه بتكون كذا بس ماتوقع ... وعندي احساس بتصير احداث مثلا ايلي بتكون حامل وراح نعرف سبب الحمل . اذا بتسال كيف عرفت بتكون حامل لختمت انشارتد ٤ وجيت بتلعب ببنت نيثن دريك راح تشوف صوره لايلي وهي حامل
الشذوذ قصدك
@hamod_alfheid  ان شاء الله تطلع حلوه كلامك مطمئن شوي صراحه 😂👌🏼
@i.cafu_2 هو غالبا فكرة عادية زي الجزء الأول توصل إيلي بس اهم شيء التفاصيل زي علاقة إيلي وجول والأحداث والمفاجئات وكذا حتى لو القصة انتقام اكيد فيها تفاصيل يمكن تخليها افضل من الجزء الأول
@i.cafu_2 😂💔 .. وعندي احساس جول مراح يموت يمكن ايلي هي الي بتموت مو جول عندي احساس بيجحفل امنا نيل دركمن
ان شاء الله نلعب فيه لو مرحلة وحدة
@abadedfgg هو اتفق معك انا مثال ثاني قود اوف وار وش الهدف وصل الرماد أعلى قمه  مو هدف يحمس ونفس الجزء السالفة بالعلاقه والأحداث البسيطه بينهم اتمني بس تكون لعبة جباره
@hamod_alfheid  والله مدري احس انا ان خوي جول نسيت اسمه هو اللي احسه بيموت بس نشوف ان شاء الله اذا نزلت
احس انه جملة "بيلعب دور كبير" يعني بيموت 😭😂😂
طبعا هو ابطل الابطال خلي ايلينا تسري بس
المفروض ثلاث ارباع اللعب يكون بجول 😍
للحين ماجربت الجزء الاول 😎 بتكون مجانية وراح اشقها شق
@amazingsami جول ولا هدف 🤭🤣
@yazan_aj3 لاتحرق 🤣🤣 هههه شكلك قاري المانجاا هههههههههه
@yazan_aj3 يمكن
جول الضلع ابن الضلع ❤️
ماااارررررره
هذه الاخبار والله 🔥
مو قادر ابلع القصه 😞 نفس الشي ذا ووكن ديد 😞💔
🔥🔥😍
اصلا العبه من غيره ماتسوي😍
انا خايف منه الجزء الثاني هين من ناحية القيم بلاي اسطوري بس القصه اخاف تطلع سطحيه
@scharf_michael
@bigbodytolito At this moment just a mag, optic and a sniper stock. It seems to charge pretty fast already. It also damages during the charge time unlike the Havoc.
@savior_of_fishy neither
Wouldn't have guessed this
Ugh another energy weapon?
A anti titan weapon huh
OHHH ITS THAT SHITTY GUN thank the Lord that... Don't believe in lol but ayye it's not the EPG so I don't care
@hentai_fapper_surpreme I mean Gibraltar is kind of a titan right? 😂
@theapexpost i guess your right 😂
Its a solid 9.5 for me🙌🏼
Haven’t try this boii in apex, but good luck shooting pilot with that.
YOU’D USE THIS TO KILL TITANS FUCKING TITANS BEHEMOTHS MAD FROM TITANIUM AND ITS JUST AROUNF THE MAP?!?
Hmmmmmmm... I'm just curious as if this will be a dangerous weapon to go against. Do you know if the burning effect also burns ammo? Or does it all count as a single round?
Go to PlayersLounge.co for online betting with Apex, you can do 1v1s or tournaments. See ya on the field 😎
IT WAS AN ANITI TITAIN WEPON IT WAS MADE TO DESTROY 100-300 TON ROBOTS
Bit op
It's like the binary rifle in halo 5 when the laser shoots out of the gun when you zoom in
@caustic_main.mp4 ok
Every season when a new weapon comes out: ThAtS sO oP wTf🥴🥴
Ahh shi we ll die like a titan
I am happy as long it not a one shot one kill weapon, and maybe there can can a hop up be added that it charges faster
@savior_of_fishy you think they would make the TurboCharger Available for it.
Nooooo

@cast.davide oke
@f_magno_ hitman
@simone_arconti thanks
Interesting...Gaiden and Echoes are pretty much equal for you, huh?
@lucky3000zx no? Like I prefer Echoes but both are good they're one and done for me since echoes for a remake doesnt offer much post game past Thabes which is a shame, more pitchforks woulda helped the replay ability
I can respect Thracia for being experimental at the very least. Doesn't mean it made the best decisions on everything.
@melon_64 its sad when healers missing is the least of its problems
Thracia is bad no matter what anyone says, now if they remade it and made the maps smaller and the gameplay good it would probably be one of the best ones
If they remake both FE4/5 in one entire game that is
@exclmint if the difficulty was based on actual challenge rather than limitation or force Id like it
Surprised fates is so high not complaining just surprised
What happened in chat?😥
@that_1_crazy too many jokes that went wrong so we told eveyone to quit it otherwise she would have been down on mixer. Other than that, we were all having a good time.
@kota_908 @that_1_crazy yeah it was nothing terrible! Just had the potential of getting out of hand. But overall one of my favorite streams I’ve had so far :)
Hey I’m happy we made you laugh and have a good time

@bryzka_  mam taką nadzieje 😉
@tadeuszwnorowski nadzieję *
@mechmadhatter I mean... that’s your opinion, but I still like her :)
@johnathonmattingly98 I listed things that actually happened but who am I to argue that you shouldnt like her.
@johnathonmattingly98 yeah man that’s not opinion she’s litteraly a bratty kid that got a favorite character killed. Ofc you can have your own opinion, but objectively a majority of players despise her.
@aidan_ping Okay okay 😅. Maybe I’m not a fan of her at all. She is a bit annoying
@johnathonmattingly98 knew you’d come to the light side, I just miss my old main dawg. Rip her.
I saw this on my explore feed and i thought it was talking about evangelion bc i don’t know anything about borderlands lol
nah,that happens to me to
@mechmadhatter i fucking hate Ava
@mechmadhatter they made her face way too big and her character was so irritating
@mechmadhatter she's not bad at all tho
And then walking all the way to the drop pod amirite
@mechmadhatter I like Ava. She is a shitty annoying and asshole teen and I am also a teen therefor I understand she doesn’t always think straight. She could use some work at certain points, but honestly her being an ass about a character’s death is kind of how some people work. She doesn’t want to take the blame, maybe she doesn’t even think she is at fault.
@aidan_ping it’s called learning. Yeah she fucked up, many ppl do. She’ll come back as a beast in 4
@aidan_ping it’s called learning. Yeah she fucked up, many ppl do. She’ll come back as a beast in 4
@strange_anonymously bro learning from a mistake is like “oopsie daisy I dropped my pistol, can’t let that happen” not directly disobeying orders from a guardian, getting said guardian killed, and not changing in the slightest
@aidan_ping you must’ve missed *insert huge movie, video game, story here where an important character gets someone killed*. She seemed more somber at the end. The point was to get you to be annoyed by her, same with tyreen
@strange_anonymously well I mean... it worked? Why make a character just to have anyone hate her. A main characters
@aidan_ping bc that’s how good of a job they did with her character. She was supposed to be the angsty child. I think you fucking forget that they live in a SAVAGE reality compared to our own lol. Being an angsty teen has way higher stakes obviously, and she paid for it. Not like she’s a normal human on earth.
You know if there’s long dialogue you can just save quit and it should skip all of it

So god damn boring waiting for the dialouge and the cutscenes to finish in like my 4th playtrough
My nightmares consist of Ava being a character.
@mechmadhatter Ava is not THAT bad
@johnathonmattingly98 she was rewarded after being childish and getting someone killed.

I hate that shit
I miss slag.
@tm_mysticall holy shit i just noticed its missing
@diamond__shaun_2004 I loved Maya. so it's a element in my heart ..
@tm_mysticall I don't see why they removed it I guess it made the game easy but still bl3 just feels wierd
@sam_calleya no they took it out because radiation was a more realistic element. and since Jack is dead nobody is experimenting with slag. making all types of productions with it halted after his death :/ if it made it too easy radiation wouldn't exist.  radiation makes enemies take more damage and tick for damage over time
Its a good weapon, it has no charge
And it was his choice + desighn
The only good Maliwan gun in the game
Maliwan makes some bomb ass smgs tho. Best part about the shotgun is it can do radiation damage
The Trevonator is actually good as fuck though cause it doesn’t have a charge-up
It’s a really good gun lol
They killed him before he was dead, yikes
That’s depressing.
@tansor3of3 @jabsy5 I have the trevonator 😂😂
The trevonator isn’t bad
😂😂
@mattjg1221 if it took more than 1 bullet, you weren’t using a Jakobs
@kyle_mutz  thats a nice slogan,mind if i use it?
@ignkli it’s the Jakob’s slogan dog, not mine, I love it tho
@kyle_mutz nah tgats not what i meant,theres a typhon log where typhon says that and Montgomery jakobs asks if he can use it
@ignkli oh rly, damn now I gotta go farm the typhon logs
@kyle_mutz heh yeah
Only good maliwan guns are shotguns though
@timstagram.jpg and smg
@_a_man_has_no_username_  oof
@ryan_oc72 U haven’t found the one with 3k radiation damage a sec then ahaha
@keenan.julseth is that the something storm one?
@_fxnlay I’m not sure it’s a legendary tho I’ll let ya know when I pop on
@keenan.julseth thanks :D, isn't it yellow with like a pixelley Borderlands logo (from memory lmao but idk)
@mattjg1221 ayyyeee
@_fxnlay I was pretty baked when I got it but it’s a charge to shoot and it goes to different enemies on death and bullets bounce around
@heesouthern no cap 😂🙏💯
@keenan.julseth ohhhh yeah
That’s so wack 😅😅
where's my explosive sword shooting shotgun?
Men of culture i see
It's really good
is that the gun for the guy that had cancer and they gave him borderlands a few months early to honor him?
What’s it called?
Maliwan shotguns low key good with punching build siren
@whiskyndguns yeah man,jakobs guns are best,you ever use the one punch chump? godly
They done em dirty
@eli.8p the splash on some maliwan pistols are pretty nice with moze in normel mode
That shotgun is actually pretty decent tho
Bruh i bet ya it does radiation damage😂

Sad truth
*sad charging fire noises*
maliwan is hot ass unless you reaaaaaallly need to bust somebody shield 🛡 😂
Trevonator?
@seanlax57 thing don’t gotta charge timr
Did you know it would have taken Frieza 5 minutes to blow up planet Namek if he hadn't needed to charge his Maliwan gun?
shit so im not the only one that ignores maliwan?
Yea maliwan sucks but some guns wich doesn't need to charge up are op
Exactly
Shark tsunami from katagawa ball is literally the only good maliwan gun
@ignkli bruh Jakob’s all the way
This shotgun is actually really good and has no charge time

@meat_cycle 🤡
Ahhh look at all you who don't wanna enjoy the game sucks to suck
@im_jordan420 Best side quest i've ever seen
@renegadeseraphx anticonsumerism comes before bl3
@feliz_navidad76 true
@ksgfordays you have any sources or proof on those claims?
@infisky they're making less money than if they sold it on steam. The pc sales for BL3 are terrible. Not to mention the fact that epic constantly poaches games to force people to use their platform
I hate Epic Games but I'd still buy it there if it isn't on Steam, lucky me I play on PS4
Oof
@getdownwiththethiccness I've been dealing with these issues for a while
@ksgfordays thats not proof
@getdownwiththethiccness I got a picture of Steam Throttling my downloads.
@ksgfordays why would they? And how are you going to prove that they're being throttled with a screenshot?
@getdownwiththethiccness my download rate (normally) is above 30 MB/s
@getdownwiththethiccness Steam thinks they can be slick by downloading stuff at less than 2 MB/s
@ksgfordays what day if the week was it taken?
@getdownwiththethiccness it was taken about 4 or so weeks ago
@ksgfordays what day of the week. Steam does maintenance around tuesdays or wednesdays to keep steam up to date and working properly
@ksgfordays and again, why would they throttle your downloads
@ksgfordays also, wtf are you talking about with the school shooting thing
Waiting it on steam, whats the problem?
Wow a business making a business deal with one of their business partners to help both of them male more money big fucking woop get over it
bruh why does it matter

@ksgfordays steam is better, but epic works just fine also so i dont understand why People hate... prob cause of fortnite
@vox.soendergaard I have more issues with Steam on a day to day basis then I ever have with Epic. Valve also ditched Half Life, allowed a game that promoted school shootings on their platform, throttles downloads.
@ksgfordays didn’t really think about those aspects, more just thinking about the launcher as a hub. Personally love the layout and such that steam use but I also like epic so why people whine is a mystery too me
@vox.soendergaard yes, Steam has features that help it. But as a storefront?  That's where it lacks tbh.
The epic games launcher isn’t even that bad tho
@feliz_navidad76 Mine is with the ui broken(like when a site dont load the images), so, yes, is that bad
I mean..... install the epic games launcher lmaooo
@silva_jacks0n. That definitely sounds like a personal issue on your end.
@ryank501 maybe
Waiting for steam lol can you believe that my Xbox live store and PlayStation  store boys?
oh damn its only on epic games,thats bullshit
I'm getting a gaming pc this christmas so I'm waiting for that. Then I'll buy it
Or because Steam takes a waaaay bigger cut off the profits and Epic is easier to work with for Developers so yea I don’t blame them. It’s not like you PC players have to buy another console.. just install the Epic Games launcher for FREE and you’re all set.
Lol this like one of the only games you can play now without having options to use money and get better... there’s even a whole side quest (a long, pretty boring one) making fun of games like that lmao borderlands is not as money hungry as any other game out there
@infisky Yes. It's not hard. I dont understand why so many people bitch about it being an epic exclusive when there is literally other exclusive games to other platforms.
@meat_cycle 🤡
If you're a true borderlands fan there is NO way you could possibly wait another 6 months to play it on steam 😭
Imagine wating for the steam version 😂
Every Epic hater is a clown at this point.
Ain't it also because they want crossplatform?

@theetheoivory__ I know, right?!
I wish there were retro game stores near me. There a lot of Gamestops, which I like, but nothing that caters to retro gamers like me.
@grumpygamer40 there aren't any near me, I usually will take a day to make the drive. This one happened to only be about an hour drive which was nice!
Love that place.
@echoendless Heh, there IS a retro game store relatively close, but it's kind of...shady, if you know what I mean. There is an awesome retro store in Skowhegan, Maine called 3D games which I visit whenever we see my father in law...unfortunately, I live in Massachusetts! We do visit whenever we can, though.

Feist is a cutie! I can’t pick just one favorite 😭 but some of the ones I like are Squirtle and Lucario 😬 I love Let’s go! It’s killing me cause I still need the Alolan Vulpix and Alolan Meowth that you can only get in Eevee to complete my collection for the game 😭
@cptfruffles the Alolan Vulpix is so cute ☺️ I usually keep her as my walking companion
@celestial.exe the Alolan Vulpix is BEAUTIFUL 😍

@isonade will try ty
@yusuf_altunel I mean, even normal or heroic, pick big minions and some AoE, I did it first try in normal and second try in heroic, the problem is that quicksand boss, thats the worst part of the run with all those AoE, if you can get at least 1 Kel Thuzad it will be okay the whole run. When you play against the quicksands just try to hold the Finley s hat on hand
@isonade bruh i did it in first try i am talkin about chapter 3

Alien Infestation is meant to be pretty good right?
@redretr0  I've only played a small bit of it so far, but I'm going to do a full playthrough soon. From what seen, the game is like a "Nuzlocke Metroid" if that makes sense.
@pactdragon I've no idea what that means? 😂
@redretr0 When some people play pokemon they do a "nuzlocke challenge", where if any of their pokemon faint, they can't use it anymore, and if they all faint they have to start the game over. Now imagine you're playing Metroid and you have 3 Samus' you can choose and switch off at any time. If any of those Samus' die, they die for GOOD. And if they all die, you have to start the whole game over again. That's kind of how Aliens Infestation works. You have a limited number of people, and you must keep them all alive lol. That made sense I hope? 😮
@pactdragon ok that makes sense and actually sounds pretty cool! Guess examples work best when you know the games other people play haha, I love Pokémon so can relate to that (although never heard of it before, that's a pretty awesome idea) but I've never played Metroid. Basically it's perma-death! 👍
@redretr0 OH MAN. You have to play Metroid! I started with Metroid Fusion but I would say that Super Metroid is a good starting point. And thought I've never actually tried a Nuzlocke myself, I'd reccomend that too. It changes the whole formula apparently.
@pactdragon na I'm well aware of Metroid and it's totally not for me 😂 I'm pretty much a RPG and survival horror only gamer! Definitely have to give a Nuzlocke run a go sometime though, sounds like it'll add some challenge and extra tension!!
Thanks for the tag!

@ventsislavaplp
The same day i get out of the bathroom to look into the mirror and find a coackaroach on my neck, i see this
If it flies I say bye hit the dash before I die stubbed my toe I started to cry
@boi_vii bro....😭😭😨
@___birdman____ yeah...
Nah u right
@boi_vii rip bro
If that happens imma head out 😓🔫
If it flies then I'll say goodbye, I'll bring that spray for it's demise 
If I miss I ditch and take the risk and know it'll be waiting to greet me back with a kiss
If it does, I'll hit the dash and light a match cause theres no point in no demon's trash @god.420.69 @vqwlc2
@neverthoughtout lol ***living in no demon's trash
Cockroqches that cant fly are genderless
I thought this was the SpongeBob cockroach meme
@neverthoughtout osm
The cockroach approves of this post. 👏🔥
I bring that spray for your demise
It’s confirmed to be a boy. His Japanese name’s Gou and his goal is to find Mew and Catch all Pokémon although I don’t see the latter happening
Hahah it's Sawmill, love that dude
Man, how the frick is he not a girl
@nidalderoo Isn't that the same as Red though?
theres only 1 gender is @nerf or nothing
Its a boy
I know its a meme or something but- why would anyone be so stupid ;-;
Boy

@roobygames I can’t believe we still never got a Flash game D:
@elvplay a flash game would be lit!! i’d also love to see a titans game based around the netflix show!
I love batman. He's like my fav but overused in games we have like 5 batman games already and they can't come up with anything new. They always sell us the same shit--the annoying riddler trophies and the villain side quests with occasional murder scenes and then you have the plot where you usually battle joker except in the arkham knight but they pulled the same crap with the side missions. I wanna see something fresh not an overused concept recycled 1000x times and then they say look a new game where its basically the same thing just unnatural graphics that make your computer overheat fast and not to mention the annoying lag
No I’m not 🌝.
YES CANT WAIT
Hell yes
I bet the Arkham games like 75 times, one of the best games.
@roobygames I didn’t saw the show yet :o
@tisha_stark_ I agree they either need to add new things or change the Hero :(
@4zra 🥺
@yavan_santiago I hope it will add new things :)
@maxsdenbrough They are so good
@elvplay it’s so good!!
@roobygames I liked almost every Dc show I saw haha
Fuck yeah! 🤩
@elvplay I hope it's more realistic like while your fighting the suit can get damaged and like bruce can get injured and you have to go to like a secret safehouse or safehouse throughout the city to heal and where you have to play as bruce in the day and expand Wayne enterprise and while you expand you unlock better things for batman idk I have allot of ideas and we would be here a while if I put them all
Just give me an announcement and then, I’ll answer your question.
I'm hyped!
@elvplay they need to make a JL or JLA game on this engine.
Lemme see the game first.
I finished Arkham Knight the only thing is the ridder trophies
Wait hold on, source?? I needa see it for myself
eh not super excited bc i’d love to see other DC games, i feel like they always use batman (i get it’s a popularity thing but still 😂)
@adri29x Good luck with it!
@vincent_the_ace Warner bros games on twitter

@garfieldisdoc 😂😂
@chrisklippel alors je continuerai à te suivre dans toutes ces aventures ! 🔥
@souleymane_75 Pour la théorie du viol cela fait peur mais ... si cela s’avère être vrai ce sera dans l’idée de dénoncer ! Malheureusement, ce sont des choses qui arrivent. Si Naughty Dog l’intègre bien, cela peut briser le cœur, mais cela peut être quelque chose de bien ! A voir, je fais confiance aux Dogs.
@chrisklippel c’est vrai mai ça serait tellement terrible mai bon fessons leur confiance  hate vraiment 👍🏻
@alexcarme avec grand plaisir ! 
Prochaine etape : Le Grand Tour #NSTG Part.2 en octobre ! 🔥
Oh non la bouille. Trop mignon.

Aujourd'hui, nous sommes 100.000 sur Rockstar Mag', et je donnerai tout pour continuer à faire du bon travail. J'ai la chance d'être entouré par les meilleurs staffs du Rockstar Mag' et Naughty Dog Mag'. J'ai la chance d'avoir plein, plein, plein de projets sur le feu avec ces deux sites. La chance de faire partie d'une team incroyable sur Presse-citron. Les prochains mois seront beaux les amis ! Promis, je ne changerai pas et je continuerai ainsi, car vous avoir à mes côtés tous les jours est quelque chose de beaucoup trop bien ! 
En prime, voici cette fameuse première photo de "Chris Liberty93" le 14 avril 2014. La première fois où ma tête
est arrivé sur le net ! C'est mon petit cadeau haha ! 
Encore merci, vraiment. À ceux qui sont là depuis le début, à ceux qui sont là depuis peu, à ceux qui ont cru en moi, à ceux qui m'ont donné ma chance. À très bientôt ❤️ #JeuxVideo #JeuVideo #VideoGame #VideoGames #Geek #Passion #Merci #RockstarGames #NaughtyDog

Could you credit artists for once :'))))))
@oceankilledme game boy color lol
@ninten.d.hoe yea but it’s obvious that the #gbc tag is used for things entirely other than gameboy color. Don’t get me wrong, I still have my gbc, just think that there should be a diff tag for it
@kirbyfansclub7 they don't know who it is so they put "?" 's
@ramen_qwq it is actually copyright infringement to post art without properly crediting

@vzanfer esta win fue muy reloca!! JAJAJA💕
@roberto.pantoli si jakznans
@fausto_lombardi Te lo pasas de nuevo en más dificultad, no eres de esos?
@aelias.xee claro que si!! lo paso 30 veces!! Saco todos los trofeos y después se acaba el juego y no hay multijugador.
Son unos chotos, así pueden lucrar dos veces con el mismo juego.
@jesusitrafael pues, juegos como God of War, spiderman y days gone carecían de multijugador, y son grandes juegos... Además, TLoU2 tiende a ser posiblemente el mejor juego de la generación, no es necesario un multijugador...
@fausto_lombardi pero el multijugador de the last of us murió desde que salió el juego. A la gente le chupa un huevo el multijugador.
@fausto_lombardi lo que pasa es que los multijugadores de ND son malos
Mejor
Realmente no tendrá de salida, luego se lo colocarán
@juandavidpaz era un multijugador muy entretenido con variedad de todo armas, mapas, personajes, ropa y con un solo objetivo cuidar tu aldea ningún juego multi tiene eso, un multijugador con mucho mucho potencial para reemplazar uncharted 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
@jesusitrafael si, pero pues el juego como tal no lo necesita... Y la otra es que se rumorea que el multijugador saldrá después, así como pasó con el 1 o con gta5
Noooooo la cagaron ,el online del 1 era claveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ndeah
@frann_fz no man yo el 1 lo disfrute tanto q la historia parece una maravillosa película pero 1 2 o 3 veces te lo pasas la historia, después para eso esta el online para disfrutar el juego en si pero de otra forma, va yo lo vi así en el caso del 1
QUEEEEEEEE VERGAA
Excelente juego, ojalá y si metan el online bien trabando luego del lanzamiento.
@andgg1982 por?
@aeportillo95 historias como esas no necesitan multiplayer, se deben de gozar y disfrutar en campaña de solitario, nada de battle royale o similares, pierde esencia, no todos los juegos deben de tener la opción que porque así está el mercado
Ellos quieren hacer algo más grande para el multijugador, pero eso demorará, entonces por eso no lo metieron
@andgg1982 después de terminar el juego unas 2 veces por completo no me molestaría tener el multiplayer para seguir jugando...
@andgg1982 que yo recuerde el 1 tenia multijugador y no afectaba en nada a la historia
@andgg1982 lo que quieren hacer es coger y venderte un pack expansion con el multijugador y lucrarse sacando unos eurillos, tiene pinta si dicen que no descartan meterlo
Nooooooooio
Esto se llama podrir un juego
😕😕😕😕😕😕😖😓 tocará esperar a ver
Esto se llama, hacer un juego puro.
Ya saben que muere Dina xD
Mucho mejor, primero que se centren en hacer un buen.
.-.
Todos dicen que es malo por mi tener multijugador. Se nota que no saben disfrutar un juego...
Ya la cagaron!!!!
Quiero que sea a la de ya , suena bien , como tipo supervivencia el mejor clan gana 💣💥
@fausto_lombardi Tas loco
@jesusitrafael Wtf
Si @santamonicastudio pudo hacerlo con God of War, @naughty_dog_inc No se iva a dejar. Si quieren un juego con multiplayer váyanse a cualquier Battle Royale o Shooter 😴😴👌🏽
@aelias.xee se ve que eres una mierda para ese juego en multi
Que sad.
@jesusitrafael Ah bueno, te me cuidas ;v
Con la historia me conformo
😍😍
No la quieren cagar como santa monica con god of war asensions
@aelias.xee pasas el Juego 100% y ya, a guardarlo!!! Eso era antes que los Juegos eran baratos y no importaba terminar uno porque uno compraba 10 juegos en un mes.
Que excelente noticia
De momento se rumorea que si tendra multijugador pero no saldra de lanzamiento 😞
@razaqui psssss
@junior_quijano igual seguiríamos jugando Fortnite... con toda esa inversión ya siento esto como una obligación 🤷🏻‍♂️😞
me suena a negocio eso de una posible expansión($) para multijugador
Basura

YESSSSAHAHSHEBDHCURNNT
Gives me halo vibes
Still miss the warmind theme deafening you every time you would load up the game
That's spoopy
@we_have_sacks_now same or buy it day comes out still haven't asked if I can get it
It has a dragon age 2 vibe to it 🔥
Loud as always 👏👏👏
I might just stay home from school lol

Taken King Intro for me all the way, this is still high quality tho
100 000 times better then the last one
Bungie actually noticed me! Red is my fav color! 🥺😪
Just remember once we press A or X, that same screen will blind us afterwards😅
@shank_killer_killer_of_shanks haunted
@autist_central nah this hit hard, dont want people complaining about loud music
It has a taken king feel to it
I'm ready!!
@valcauor we’re not complaining! WE WANT LOUDER 😂

@drew.mauriello yes.

Yeah how fucking LOUD is it going to be though
D1 is the best
I disown this load up music. It needs to ass blast the shit out of your eardrums to be considered a D2 loading screen theme. This ain't it
YOOOOOOO

I'm a LB main and I forgot all about long arm honestly
@_northty99_ don’t tell anyone but I did that longarm on accident because i too forgot it was a thing
I totally forgot about that move
Ye im a lawbro main and so many times ill be trying to gb while walking backwards and accidentally do that
Did lawbro finally git gud? As Roman prophesied?
That poor Shaolin, just tryba feint to GB 😭😭
Anyone who has the balls to casually long arm is an absolute unit
Sometimes I use it predictively on people who dodge a lot and it works sometimes. Yeah I could parry the dodge attack, or guard break, or do literally anything but the long arm, but gotta flex, ya know?
🙌If you love game follow me 😁 @playstationbox1

Look killer! Even Capcom had to make 2 3D models of Chris’s knife because of that same reason... it was too large for the sheath 😅
@baldguycosplay ⚔️
@officialhunk Haha I always wondered because the blade is HUGE 😂
Wow!!! That's not metal! Without the process picture I would never know it was wood! Awesome
We'll put it to good use.
@ceslo_maker thanks that’s the idea! Filler primer does amazing stuff. 👍

@pictagor Thank you! 😁🙌
@gamedev.tv 🙌🙌
@rokassutkus Were trying to mow the enemies look all ghostly and morphy. Glad you like it 😊
@whistlingwizardnz nice! Hoe many bosses like that do you have?
@rokassutkus Currently, there is a plan to have around 7 big bosses throughout the game. With some challenging mini bosses thrown in the mix. This is all subject to change though 😊
@whistlingwizardnz 7 major boses? That quite a lot, I hope they'll give us a challenge 😄
Wow :D This is my new favorite piece :D
@amiracle_sheep Nice! I'm glad you like it 😁
I love this!! I’m amazed at how beautiful this game looks. Every screenshot you guys have posted has looked gorgeous.

@troth72 that’s a good question? Do you earn them quicker ?
They need to update the park rep
@1400_bez yea I’m guessing since the said “buffed” it should boost progression. I hope so.

Me a more intellectual then this person , knows that the circle is made up of tiny pixels which are squares therefore making it not a perfect circle
@basil_asap_saeed
Pixelated. Not a true circle.

@fomp.png any circle in a game is pixelated cause that's how screens work so technically all circles in games arent true circles

I hated forsaken’s loading screen the purple and yellow was ugly
Finally no ear rape and white eyes killer
Where can I preload? I have everything installed but I don’t thing the title page has updated
So as soon as I get home tomorrow I can get straight on and play or do I have to download more stuff?
@sebyisaperson i think because its endgame now that u wont need to download an update
@sebyisaperson but if one shoould come out then just an hotfix or day 1 patch and they are like 200mb
@malek.dmk ok that’s good thank you
I'm gonna fucking jump off a bridge if I don't get this expansion before October ends
@sebyisaperson @malek.dmk There’s the initial 28GB update which will be all of the new content, apart from that, there may be a 50-300mb patch if they’ve tweaked anything. You should be okay 😉
@skelepanda i feel you brother
Same here
WHOS EXCITED FOR DESTINY BUT DARK MODE
How long did it take
@skelepanda isn't it free tho?
@mason.j.morris no i think its the other expansions like warmind that are gonna be free with new light
How loud is it? Louder than warmind? Louder than rise of iron? Louder than taken king?????
@skelepanda damn cuz I just started playing again cuz there free and I was hyped to play
@mason.j.morris yeah, I know the feels man. The expansion is 40 if anything
I’m looking forward to the soundtrack
@stephen.f.b oh and the new lore
@stephen.f.b I’m just sat here listening to the soundtrack now 😂
@destiny_unforgotten in the trailers and stuff it sounds super dope
NEW LOADING SCREEN
Honestly. I am just happy I stuck it out through the rough patches of content droughts etc because I now get to enjoy the artistry of Bungie unhinged!!! Lets go! #erisBAE
So wait isn't the servers down
THE MUSIC 😍🔥🔥
I'm all preloaded on steam and BEYOND ready for new content!
The story, armor, weapons, raid, dungeon, and lore.
Basically EVERYTHING. 😤
(except the weapon damage multiplier nerfs 😔)
Omg it’s beautiful.
@skye_engel should be
Unfortunately I just got a new job last week and time off has to be 2 weeks in advance 😭 but I'll be playing a ton tomorrow night, I'm so so excited
Wait so we have to pre load it on steam to transfer account from blizzard?
Getting my EMA to buy the damn exspansion..
The title screen gave me goosebumps... I love it
@luxon500 you can if you want to, or you can wait till it releases
how many gbs
Time to see bungie at their full potential with nothing holding then back! I’m super excited!
@harrison.cordill thanks, i thought i wouldnt have to download it again, how silly of me

Are the Etsy preorders factored into the Kickstarter cost? (Like the Yoel amount required to find the Kickstarter would be less than last time because preorders have happened?)
@candlejack I will be putting preorders in with the kickstarter cost 😊 I will put in the ks updates when a design is funded with the aid of preorders. Hopefully things go better this time since I extended the ks to 30 days as well!
Que bien! El trailer junto a cod mobile ❤️
👍
Uffff
Esta genial 😎
Yes 😍
lowkey might be helpful with ken and ryu in smash
Those look pretty cool
I’m bought one of your charging station and it’s so bad worse purchase ever
So, just curious, could these also work on pc, since I have Skullgirls on my laptop, and using the pro controller doesn't feel right by me
Perfect! 😍
60$..............
$60?
😮
$60? 🤒
$60 is a very reasonable price for this controller IF it's built to handle the intense button smashing it's designed for.
@emily.nikolas.aiden
Wait... This one doesn't have a joystick... How tf am i supposed to play smash with this
@jozefkarst antismash propaganda
How much tho
I love the look, but for not enough for 60. For 9 more bucks I can grab a Qanaba Drone Arcade stick.
That is interesting
Does it have 2 shoulder buttons or 4?
Why can't they just make 1 controller that can be used all systems bruh come on
@ravioli.562 ? I love smash....
Your da bes company!
Ayy sully there’s something behind you dude

@cause.black а уже 1 октября?
Боже, ЕА, это ваш единственный афигенийшый проект, я очень долго любил линейку Батлы, но первая часть была последним гвоздём в крышке BF, но поиграв в Апекс на пс4, я понял что вы ещё могёте, продолжайте заниматься этой игрой, это самый годный батлрояль, из всего что сейчас есть, по крайней мере от лица консольщика говорю, жду обнову, даже донатить в эту игру есть маленькое желание.
@stan_anders ребят, я не бот, бля буду)
@stan_anders как консольщик говорю, что арех - единственный проект, на который я сейчас трачу всё своё свободное время
@igor_yatsenko.22 согласен полностью
@dart_vader_666 в Китае - да. Следующий вопрос
@cause.black EA китайская компания?
Между нами тает лёд...
@cause.black должны выпустить ~ 20:00 по МСК
@igor_yatsenko.22 спасибо 🤝
@javigeek copa bebe meirio☺️
Yo he escuchado mucha crítica y queja pero no lo he probado
Lo he probado y para jugar de vez en cuando va bien 😜
Aún no me dió ni tiempo a bajármelo!! Qué tal es?? 👌
Yo lo he probado, y para ser un juego de móvil es bastante divertido 😁.
@javigeek es que si no fuera de ese modo, hubiera sido un verdadero rollo para jugarlo, para mi han acertado con el juego y si saben hacer un buen multijugador lo pueden llegar a petar
Loveeeee love love this! 😁💙 I haven’t actually managed to get on this yet, so much to do, so little time!!!
@javigeek jajajaja nono 😂 que este año tengo que jugar menos y estudiar más 😂😂😂😂😂
Paso mucho de los juegos para móviles pero aun así habrá que darle un try 👏
Se repiten mucho los escenarios... Y va poco a poco ocupando mucho espacio
I have tried and I am loving to play him friend
@javigeek le falta algo tio
I LOVE this game 😆😆😆 The controllers are a bit hard but it’s still so much fun!
Me lo pienso descargar hoy jajajaa
😍
Pues no me gustó para nada el control, creo que puede ser mejorado e incluso cambiarlo por uno más intuitivo; además el sistema para desbloquear está demasiado pesado
Más malo que pegarle a un padre 🤮
@kaietan hahahahaha miralo por el lado positivo...es gratis!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Woahhh this shot is BEAUTIFUL😍😍😍😍🌈🎉
@javigeek yaaaa sabes esa expresión "ni regalao?" 🤣 Es que acostumbrado al MK8...
@mrsdaniyt muchas gracias serdito! 😍😍😍😍
@manuzs_toys si??? Tanto estas enganchado??? 😏
@galavintage18 tienes que acostumbrarte al control y ya 😬😬😬
@saikoland hahahahaah es que el de switch es el más completo hasta la fecha 😍😍😍😍
@srbarher bueno no bien...es raro pero cuando te acostumbres 😍😍😍
@scrafygamer para pasar el rato está genial tío 😘😘😘
@retrojuegazos 😍😍😍😍😍
@indiesreviews siii! Pruébalo y me dices 😬😬😬😬
@carloscolomo si verdad? Mola eso de que se descargue solo 😏😏😏😏
@ibericangamer creo que te va a encantar 😍😍😍😍
@javigeek ni idea loco,como que se me hacen rarisimo los controles😨
@futurelegendgaming Try it, you'll see how you like it !! 😬😬😬
@annecromancy y a que esperas???? 😏😏😏
@solidrak y eso?? No tienes tiempo o que??? 😏
@rebecca488.inthegame thanks mate!!! 😍😍😍😍
@javigeek no te voy a engañar 😂😂😂
@magic_gamerx a mi el control me echaba para atrás... Pero después de acostumbrarme creo que es todo un acierto poder jugar con un solo dedo 😬😬
@shadowzone187 thanks bro 😘😘😘😘
@koke.barker si? Por donde vas ya?? 😏😏
La verdad es que no soy mucho de jugar con el móvil... no me gustan los controles en pantalla..😅 pero parece un vicio!!😉👌
Lo tenia ya reservado..... 😂. Muy chulo 👌🏼
Me lo tengo que descargar a ver como funka!!!
On the phone? Nah not yet mate
Yo me lo quiero descargar!!! 😍🖤
@mysecondplayer A mí me encanta es raro jugar en vertical, pero me encanta
Ooo lo tengo descargado pero no puedo darle mucho😁 espero que lo estes disfrutando. Como siempre fotaza😁
Stunning shot there friend
Yo creo @javigeek que hay muchas reseñas negativas acerca del juego porque intentan compararlo con el juego original de consola, hay que tener muy en cuenta las limitaciones que presenta un móvil a la hora de intentar traer un juego de estas características, ya que no se dispone de gatillos con los que derrapar o lanzar los objetos, es por ello que el sistema que se ha elegido es el desplazamiento por la pantalla de los dedos y sin duda para mi ha sido un acierto, al igual que hacer que las carrera s sean de dos vueltas, porque así nunca tienes asegurado nada, a la que te despistas, ya no tienes modo de remontar
Nice, I check it out and download it 💚🤩! Enjoy man
Yo me estoy viciando al juego, me esta gustando lo unico que ya se empieza a complicar y parece q hay que gastarse pasta pra mejorar puntuación
@cisc0frank pues deberías a lo principio ralla porque el control es algo malo pero luego mola mucho 😍😍😍😍
@marpokhar pruébalo que ya verás como te gusta 😍😍😍😍
This Picture is amazing!! I love that all your Pictures are so colorful 😍😍😍🥰🥰 And I haven’t tried this game yet but probably won’t hahah I‘m not that mobile game gamer but I LOVE  Dr. Mario haha
@mysecondplayer el control a lo primero ralla un poco, pero después va genial cuándo te acostumbras 😬
@thejm9collections hahahahaha y eso porque??? 😍😍😍😍
@erika_valkiria y eso?? Que tw sucede?? 😏😏
@nachoez eso me pasaba a mi, pero luego te acostumbras a jugar con un dedo 😬
@gamers.bcn hahahahahha bájatelo perro que ya sabes lo que jugamos al doctor Mario 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@retrojuegazos hahahahahha cuando te lo acabes me dices que tal 😬😬😬
@my_games_rocks bueno ya lo tiene ganado con las consolas 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@trayectoriagamer yo sólo los de Nintendo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@electro_retrogames a mi el control no me gustaba pero ahora ya voy mejor
Que vicio tío 😂😂😂😂👌👌👌
@frakergame bueno era o desinstalarlo o jugar 🤣🤣🤣
@worldofanaeris no te asustes con el control porqué es malissimo por lo demás 😍😍
@jordidelmas porqué? Es buen juego eh?? 😬😬😬
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies hahahahahha este Mario Kart mola porqué son partidas cortas 😍😍😍😍
@taburoto si que estas ocupado!!! 🤣🤣🤣
@taburoto 😏😏😏😏😏
@cristiano_mad tanta? A mi el control pies si pero le acabas pillando el tranquilo 😬
@apisonthebeat el control que a lo principio es asqueroso 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yo lo tengo desde hace unos días,pero creo que mis expectativas eran demasiado altas,pero no está mal como juego🤗🤗☺️
@javigeek Ya lo pondré 🕹️😂🎮🍺... TiempO 💕🥶 TengO 😆🍾
@javigeek ChavaL 🤣🏖️ Tu sabes lo qué es 😂 TOL PUTO 🤪🍾 DÍA 💞 TUMBAO EN EL SOFÁ...?😂🍺💯
Lo he probado pero me gusta muchísimo más el de Switch, solo eche un par de partidas y ya me dieron ganas de poner el Mario Kart 8 😂
Aún no lo probé!! Que tal es? El control bien? Y la familia? Todo bien? ❤️
Aún no lo he probado, no suelo ser mucho de jugar en el móvil, pero me han hablado bien de él
Aun tengo que descargarlo... estoy demasiado enganchado al Zelda Awakening como para estar pendiente de otra cosa 🤣🤣🔥❤️
No lo he probado, tiene online o que? 🙌
@javigeek si, por eso lo digo! Temo que si hago pop no haré stop 🤪 vamos, que me pegaría la viciada de mi vida 🤣🤣🤣 🔝👌
@j_s_carpio es de lo que me queje yo cuando salió del control, pero te acabas enganchando 🤣
Probado y decepción Javi :(
😂👏💨💨💨⛽🚙🚑🏍️
E lo bajé hacé DÍAS 😪🤣🏖️ Y NI HE JUGADO ⚽😎🏋️😝💗
Haber si me PongO 🏋️😂... TanTo SpectruM 🕹️🤪💗
@taburoto ya lo has probado? 😬😬😬
No lo he probado aún ! Que tal es?? Y La foto de 10 ! Feliz día javiruli!
Aun no lo probé e igual no le doy la oportunidad. Mucha cosa en el móvil y muy viciada la batería
No lo hemos probado aún pero ya hemos leído varias opiniones negativas.. Que puede tener malo un Mario kart? 😂
Pues he hecho el tutorial y ahi me he quedado tio
A mi me marea 😂
Los controles no me gustan pero el juego es bestial
Buhh, no le doy a las drogas 😂 que por eso mejor no bajarmelo 😂😂
Aun tengo que descargarlo... estoy demasiado enganchado al Zelda Awakening como para estar pendiente de otra cosa 🤣🤣🔥❤️
Esta gente va a reventar el mercado de los videojuegos en el móvil.
@redbasketyt yo me quejaba del control pero ya me he acostumbrado 😍😍😍😍
@laleoneradepapa yo sólo a estos juegos de Nintendo, los demás ni los miro 😬😬😬
@sparda1981 Thanks my bro !! Have a great day !! 😍😍😍
Me hablado un compañero de curro hoy me lo tengo que bajar para probarlo 😍😍😍 gran foto vecino eres todo un artista 🤣🤣😍
@lemasi23 dejaselo a tu hijo que ya verás como le da caña 😍😍😍
Hahahahahaha lo descargué hoy para probarlo, hasta ahora me gusta, pero me quedo con Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 😍😍 que genial!! 😍
Necesitas un arreglillo o un apaño? llama a Mario q trabaja las 24h en casa de Javi 😁
He jugado mucho cuando finalizo el día y si hoy jugare la nueva copa que han liberado 😍😍😍 lo malo es el micro pago y es más caro que un año de suscripción a switch online para tener el pase dorado 😭😭😭😭 y eso hacer que pierda toda la magia
El control no me convence y lo preferia horizontal en vez de vertical, por lo demás está muy guay.
Yo he jugado bastante y está muy chulo ♥️♥️
No lo he probado,  pero tiene que estar guay.  Yo es que no soy mucho de jugar en el móvil 😁🎮
Beautiful Picture Amigo I didn't Played I yet need to download it enjoy and have a great Week 🎮❤️🙋🏻‍♂️
No lo he probado, no soy de jugar en mvl. Bonita foto 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Noooo la verdad que en móvil juegos 0 sea cual sea no se porque! 😅
Yo le dediqué el viernes Muchas horas y la verdad está chulo el jueguito.
Me alegro que al final le hayas podido pillar el truco al control!! La verdad que Nintendo ha hecho un gran trabajo simplificándolo a un solo dedo!!😊👍
@gengaren hahahahha es que tu eres muy bueno al Mario Land 😍😍😍😍😍
Este ni lo he descargado aún, veo que hablan bien de él, tengo que darle una oportunidad 😊
Miedo me da probarlo!🤣
@beat__86 ah hahahah todo lo que sea de Mario ya sabes que me encanta 😍😍😍😍
El otro día me lo descargué y me encanto 🤩.Lo tengo en reserva para cuando me pase el Pokemon Masters
Un mario kart para movil, qué puede salir mal? 😍

Sinceramente me parece muy bien, pero me parecería mejor si después de hacer el modo historia hubiera como algún otro tipo de modo en el que podrías jugar mundo abierto.
@trovi_ por ahora no hay nada confirmado así...
Y lo de que no tiene modo online...? 🤯
@pablito.m.s parece que lo sacaran más adelante aunque no ha quedado claro
La decisión es totalmente acertada un mundo abierto, no permitiría que el jugador se sumergiera de lleno en la narrativa
@sergio.mtnz totalmente de acuerdo!
@wakkapoficial seguramente para ps5... No saben na... 😢
Mas o menos aceptable pero bueno espero sea un juegazo y que salga para PS5 después de su lanzamiento original en la vieja que es la PS4
@sergio.mtnz y el gtav?
@ronpococos888 no puedes comparar un juego que tiene como principal modo de juego el online, y por eso lo de mundo abierto; con un juego single player cuyo mayor característica es obviamente el modo historia
@sergio.mtnz principal el online? Eso es ahora, pero en su tiempo era la mejor campaña que existía y me la he pasado 3 veces
@ronpococos888 la idea de mundo abierto en GTA V funciona porque esa es la esencia del juego, el mundo abierto en the last of us no es necesario porque en vez aumentar el gameplay se vería reducido, de entrada va a salir en 2 CDs imagina no más que fuera mundo abierto
Obvio como el juegovanterior
Ya lo dijeron.Sera lineado mas abierto
Paso de discutir contigo, el peso de juego no tiene que ver con el CD, el CD es la llave, tu te lo descargas de Internet, me pones de una mala leche que alucinas diciendo que a the lust of us no le viene bien un mundo abierto. Si dices que eso no pega, dime porque hay tantos juegos de zombies de mundo abierto payaso
Genial. Sigue la línea del primero y es lo mejor que puede hacer. Obra maestra confirmada. Pocos estudios se preocupan tanto como Naughty Dog. Estudio a tener en cuenta como ejemplo Supremo de cómo hacer las cosas bien
👌🏼 Mundo abierto no siempre es la mejor opción
El mundo abierto es una tendencia que actualmente parece que es algo imperativo en todos los juegos actuales....pero en un juego como este q se centra únicamente en la historia un modo libre seria matarlo
Perfecto siento que los juegos mundo abierto suele ser muy repetitivo haciendo que muchos se aburran del juego y no lo terminen a diferencia de los juegos lineales que se disfrutan más y nos apegamos más a la historia
Se van a lo fácil... para eso mejor que no saquen nada... bueno, eso que me voy a ahorrar!

@marcel.wavy trueeee
Honestly? There needs to be consequences. Lose some health or shield or reset the ultimate. How about a ping wheel option where u can ask "are u sure u need that?" And then someone can counter ping "yeah I need it" or "go ahead and take it it's all yours"

He just like me always got his hand s in his pockets, very chill
Shit sucks makes him look like a vampire the original is way better
@o.f.e_charleemack was honestly thinking the same
It annoys me how theyve sorted the menu i-
How much is the battle pass gonna be?
@psychedelicxi8_msm always $10
Lame. His legendary should be more robotic since he's a hacker
Kinda like Dante from dmc
If they bring more legends, that’d alleviate the well known player preference issue
Nothing about this game will ever be a surprise😂, might as well just release random updates every so often that way you aren’t getting leaked all the time

Souda x Gundam is superior but kuzusouda is pretty cool too
My favorite is definitely Soul Friends (Hajime x Souda) cuz like....they're soft for eachother and Souda finally has someone he truly trusts and Hajime won't ever abandon him like the people in his past did and they'll always be there for eachother and yea, I'm very soft for Soul Friends
But also Kuzusouda is super fucking cute and I love that ship a lot too

How stunning are you missy? @sunsbookishgamesx 🤙🏾💫💖😍
Philanthropic crime--that which springs from the love of humanity and an irreverence toward that which does not
Love your vibe @sunsbookishgamesx 😍
Stealing memes and false claiming

Does anyone else ever feel like they wanna tell a girl shes beautiful but they dont want to because everyone else is doing it too? Like you know she will appreciate it but you feel like you should be doing more than that instead of just being another commentor in the community? Mabye tell them its ok to be flawed and its ok to show off your successes and achievements to the world? No just me?
None

Товарищи! Мы отправили гения @hideo_kojima в космос. Видео у меня на странице @mrbokov , либо на @alphard_astroclub В рамках популяризации науки, мы решили использовать возможность и превратить запуск зонда в небольшую экшн драму с участием героев детства. Приятного просмотра ;)
Просьба, в комментариях отметить Хидео Кодзиму, дабы он узнал об этом, и отправлять клип известным личностям и своим друзьям.
Гениально 🙃
Инновации которых мы заслужили : 3 игра которая использует динамик в джойстике
@alkotrall да
Там будут губной "ПЫК" как у куплинова в заставке видосов? Это даже не общение. Хотя, может эта игра научит нас различать различные звуки ребенка и переводить это в речь🤔 + 100 к новому языку
😳
@grey_moon_19 а какие ещё игры имеют такую функцию?
Сидишь такой,думаешь :"плойку выкл,тел выкл,ТАК ОТ КУДА БЛЕТ МЛАДЕНЕЦ ОРЕТ?!"
@vladyslav.shpak killzone точно, спуди мен вроде и все 😂

Почему через динамики? У меня только колонки😢 в компе((

Вырубай, страшно

@strawbunnyxd it looks so much better with the words!! You've got a great eye!! 😎🤘🏼🎮❤️ Don't forget, you totally designed him!! I just built him 😛
@strawbunnyxd yay!! So glad you love it!!! Can't wait to get it back in your hands!
Can’t wait to get my own board ... nice job
How do I get a n64 Gameboy?! I've wanted a n64 again because I had one as a kid but this seems way better
@jeyrohm cheers dude! 🍻 🎮🤘🏼 can't wait to see it!!
@marky_pi 😭 aww thanks so much haha still the most important part is getting designs and making them real 🎉🤗
Damn. I feel the functionality of this beats the VMU pi mods but I find the VMU ones very unique. I def def want to order that whenever and however long it takes to get on that list to order one.
This can be translated as "Rate my Saturday night"
@nikiforosplan pretty much!! 😂😂😂
@blablawoofwoof this guy definitely beats the vmus in regards to function/feature! But to me (sounds like you'd agree) they are in different categories - this guys the showoff can do all the things and the vmu is like stealth secret agent retrogaming 😎🎮😂 they both play the same stuff up to n64 but the vmu can't do n64 lol can do Psx pretty well if you consider its missing joysticks and all LOL but despite being so small they really do play well!! But this ones the one if you wanna jam out for hours on the next level 😂 this guy has hdmi out so you can play on the tv lol
@blablawoofwoof make sure to DM me to get on the list if you haven't already!! Seriously probably close to 200 messages behind but your place on the list will be determined by your first message to me!
Great combo! ;)
@retro_dodo the best!! Just needs pizza for lunch and a dessert only dinner and it's a perfect day 😛😂🎮🤘🏼
How do I get one? 😍
La mejor combinacion!👏

I do like the remake of RE2 but its not better than the original! They should have used the same music for the save rooms and maybe tweeked them a bit. I hope that nemesis gets remade that will be hella scary, feck the bioweapon in RE2 hes nothing compared to nemesis

Quase um trava língua essa frase do Leon kkk
Momento galã
E colocaram essa frase no início de uma das músicas na trilha desse jogo.
Nossa lembro q quando eu via as CGs do RE2 com meus irmão e fala q seria assim o gráfico do PS2 😂
Esses pixels maravilhosos

دعاء لمن غلبته ذنوبه:
اللهم اني استغفرك من كل ذنب تبت اليك منه ثم عدت اليه واستغفرك من كل عمل أردت به وجهك الكريم فخالطني فيه غيرك واستغفرك من كل نعمة أنعمت بها علي فاستعنت بها على معصيتك يارب لقد اتعبني كثرة ذنوبي يارب ارحمني بتركها يا تواب يارحيم اللهم مدني بقوة من عندك حتى اتغلب عليها اللهم اني اسالك باسمك الأعظم الذي اذا دعيت به أجبت واذا سئلت به اعطيت أن تطهر قلبي من حب المعاصي وتفتح لي أبواب رحمتك وتغفر لي فإنه لا يغفر الذنوب الا انت .. ولا إله إلا أنت سبحانك اني كنت من الظالمين

The servers are going to either explode tomorrow or cause a nuclear meltdown, or both.
Who else is hyped for shadow keep?

I hope I’m faster with armor 2.0 and more agile. I have to say my Hunter and Titan need better gear from top to bottom. More powerful and enhanced. I don’t mind looking good either. IKELOS smg for life baby

@andytalamante pdt
@fraser_baird 1 pm eastern 10 am west coast
Follow me for good content🙏🙏🔫🤡
Me trying to prep for shadow keep
H y p e
I sadly don't have the money for shadowkeep i am cry
Is it supposed to be live now?
I might cry 😭
@donnomaarr i was going to get it then it bugged and crota somehow fucking absorbed my gj shot and one hit my dad helping me
@iceydr3w same
It's time guardian
@oofer_doofer3000 loool that’s hilarious. Let’s hope this expansion doesn’t have any of that ridiculousness
Is that today?
Yes finally I have waited so long but I can’t even play on launch I have a football game
@destinypub yes
Hype 🚨
Time for what? :0
@avocado_dolphin I needed one more game to reach legend
Finally!
My legs are sacking 🥴
Anyone know the time it gets released
It is time!!!
@alex.rego1 true but still
Seguitemi.
Grind after school is cool cause the loading process will take hours I’m sure
When you pre ordered today😋
MOONS HAUNTED
👏🏻👏🏻
@pz_pf man
Gentlemen, the time has come
24 h 😖 but we will get shadowkeep that‘s a nice Price
@fraser_baird 10 am PST

@shadowsnake2001 est
It has begun.
The spookening begins...
Moon's haunted
Hell yesssss can’t wait till tomorrow I took 2 days off work🤗
Yooo flashbacks
@donnomaarr dont matter i would take db over d2 base dlcs anyday besides forsaken and shadowkeep
I dont got school for the next 5 days so shadowkeep will br grinded
@donnomaarr Crotas end was great, if you wanted a quick easy raid with the bois and good loot Crotas would be the go to
23 giga but ok
@avocado_dolphin but it was easy so u didnt really need a team
Moon's haunted
THE END IS NEAR BROTHERS
Let’s go boys
We have woken the hive
Let me in. LET ME IN!!!!!
Let the hype reach maximumum 😂
Pog
My duuudes!!!
@alex.rego1 agreed. Although D1 in general was better than D2 in many ways but I hear yuh
@avocado_dolphin true words. It was kinda hilarious fun too when you see crota randomly run to one side and rip your mates 😂 good times
YES
F in chat to the Mayhem match I was in.
@kwarriors214 wish I could take time off school
Its upon us boys the day we've been waiting for
@alex.rego1 ah yes, the dark below (remastered)
@destinypub lol
@destinypub ill take dark below is better tham curse and warmind
Bro I was about to dismantle my ghost shell
Need more pics
@alex.rego1 dark below was silly and Crotas end was a glorified strike, still greatful to it for the flawless raider tho 😆
I was at the boss in reckoning I’m pretty pissed ngl
Smash like if you’re hyped
Me
this is more toxic/worse than the titan 1
MOOD😂😂
Your not wrong but I wish I could be playing
Sssssooooo sweaty!  Lol
I'd have put gwisin tbh, shards are straight booty now :(
As long as I shower in a volcano after the crucible match I’d say this is a good load out
if this isn’t fax idk what is
@drdoomsdaughter bless your soul for not using the Panama ornament on chaperone. 😂
I never got that shotgun
When my computer is getting fixed and I can't fucking play shadow keep and I literally want to fucking kill myself
Lmao you make some of the best clips I've seen on here, love seeing your posts, keep it up girl
I don't use this stuff :( I feel attacked!
chap sniper spectral gang rise up
I main hunter but use revoker, recluse and 1k in qp
Instead of chaperone, LW
Happy shadow keep tommorrow everybody hope you enjoy the dlc 👍👍
@drdoomsdaughter this is a great way to deal with scum. Not sarcastic. It cleanses the community
mountaintop*
No it’s dust rock recluse/Luna wardcliff and stompys this is the true hunter build nothing else
I find these funny and yet somehow get mad since im not like that as hunter😂
Am over here with golden gun,beloved and dragonsshadow
I was just gonna say where my chaperone
@classicmaybach go for it
@_king.aj and my graviton forfeit
Can confirm
The only exotic i use is stompes for pvp
I'm a last word main fortunately 😂
I deny... don’t even know these
I think you mean Colony in Mayhem
@snazzy103 its worse than the toaster of death
@leatherman.g debatable
@leatherman.g I I think it’s worse than bunji jumping and having the cord snapping
Don’t forget spam jumping
@_.lego.yoda._ Um... you know this is a joke right? Or are you that dull... 🤦‍♀️😂
Chap recluse is a dope combo tho. Dropped so many we rans running that
@_.lego.yoda._ Haha you're on a time out
Tried to be a sweat so I equipped all my smg armor (my reaper set🤣), wardcliff, and a shotty with Galinors. Hated it so much I switched 1 minute into the game🤣
@drdoomsdaughter don't get too worked up about it it's just a joke, a "haha" as it were
YOUR TALKING MAD SHIT FOR SOMEONE IN SOLO BLADE BARRAGE DISTANCE 
Btw : we use chaperon and Luna’s with hammerhead
@snazzy103 ewww truth
I use: stompies, recluse, chaperone and spectral for the wall hacks
@leatherman.g lol I use it ironically
Now if only I had the skills to use the chaperone...oh well, back to using whatever weapon looks super cool!
@_.lego.yoda._ I ain't laughing, bub. Check yourself.
@drdoomsdaughter 😖😖chill out dawg
I don’t have recluse so I just use a year one look alike
@_.lego.yoda._ I'm cool as a cucumber. You're just not getting it. Take a walk. Imma put you on comment timeout since you don't know when to keep ya mouth shut.
@_.lego.yoda._ you have to be some kinda special! The community voted, you are part of the community if you play Destiny, just like those salty ass toxic cucks, now it's a "joke" over played and pointless to say that way to late when your called out on your 💩 should have voted or your negative opinion doesn't matter...bye felicia 👋🏽✌🏽
Im a hunter Main and i play antiope-D and sniper with spectralblades
Fuck yea lol
As someone who mainly uses this combo you’re goddamn right and I’m gonna stay that way 😂💀
@classicmaybach same here, i have a godroll gunnoras axe, atleast for me its a god roll
Hunters also SUCK. (Unless they’re on my fireteam, once again you’re alright) #yesimawarlockmain
@kxr.ize_ I have two good rolls I will send u DMs
@classicmaybach I can’t show u lol destiny is down I forgot 😂
I've tried my best to stay away from blade barrage in crucible especially testing out trees I don't normally use (bottom tree arcstrider mainly) but there are times where a good ole blade barrage is needed
@frisky_lol I bet you use bygones or some hand cannon 😂😂
@ralph.rossi_ actually an ace so yea you right 😂👍
Seee i use parcel and 21% delirium.... Idh recluse 😭😭😭
Anyone: *uses good weapon* DrDoomsDaughter: REEE NO SKILL REEE
Next she'll complain about Go Figure
I don’t use that I use Atalanta d and beloved and truth
@kxr.ize_ I do better with slugs tho like good bone structure lol
I mean it's really only bad in mayhem though 😂🌚
@_.lego.yoda._ actually, these were all of the communities opinions. I took 3 polls, nice try chief. Sit the fuck down.
For chaperone you should edit a clip to add to the WOTW of you in crucible, shooting into the abyss and getting a headshot on an enemy who isnt even in the same game
@_.lego.yoda._ gonna comment more shit? Or you done now bub?
@drdoomsdaughter also its customary to bag ... I mean dodge after every kill too, it's a hunter thing 🌚
Gun: better than traveler's chosen
@autisticangel002 community: it's too op
@imassiah oh, you mean the Canadian curtsey? 🌚😂
@drdoomsdaughter oh you right you right, that's what it's called 😂
@imassiah 💀😂😂😂
CoRrEcTiOn: I use knucklehead radar,revoker,recluse,golden gun,and truth and I d e s t r o y :)
@drdoomsdaughter L-Lego Yoda was j-just sayin...that ur community is S A L T Y
@_.lego.yoda._ no, you specifically directed it at me personally. Don't try to play this game with me.
*sniff* this is beautiful
I use none of those lmao 😂 I use revoker Luna’s with the crucible nade launcher heavy. And either dragons shadow or stompees. Maybe liars handshake if I’m feeling lucky.
Basically all mayhem hunters
@firefox101347 but I’m also an exception ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I feel bad for being a hunter main who doesnt know shit and sticks with suros
Warlocks are last cause she saved the best for last
thank you I love it
How dare you I post something about my load out I forbid this 😡😂 lol but seriously I used this before and I continue to use it😂
Your face is priceless 😂😂😂
lmao
Im the opposite
@x.rachhell.x LETS GO, BRUUUTHER *flexes*
@vertikull 😂😂 tried my best
@classicmaybach i agree lmao, also, chappie x arcstrider will always be better than blade barage 🚫🧢
Loving it
The solo blade barrage had me in creases 😂😂😅
@whooper98
My complete setup until you got to the shotgun lmao😂
@destiny_unforgotten 😂😂
that me 😂
I thought I was about to be called out 😂😤. I’m only good at gambit and use izanagis burden instead of chaperone. 😂.
🤣🤣🤣 I can’t wait for the Warlock one @drdoomsdaughter 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Solo Blade Barrage 😂
i rather use Last Word and Last Dance
😭 i'm a hunter main and i approved this msg.
Ooooooh can NOT wait to see the warlocks I actually main a warlock but I’m like 90% sure my setup is not even what warlock mains use so I can’t wait to see what you put in your video plus I’m ready to laugh just like I did for titan and hunter cuz these are really funny 😂☺️
🤦🏾‍♂️
Chaperone actually takes skill tho
@classicmaybach #headshotsonly
You done did it😂😂
I’m a hunter main but I have no recluse
Here come the can't read good, salty, offended, should of,  toxic folks 😂😂🤣💀💀
This is my PvE setup... My PvP setup is bottom tree tether, Oathkeepers, Breakneck, Le Monarque, and Goldtusk... But yes this is my exact PvE setup.
this is true
I use shards of galanor, but to be fair...it has enhanced handcannon loader and I don’t wanna use drop mag on my kill clip rampage kindled orchid
This makes me hyped for the Warlock one. I'm ready to get my magic ass roasted.
*RAISES HUNTER META SCRUB FLAG* I’ll one man blade barrage you SO HARD! Let’s go! 😂
Sweaty forehead
😂😂

@andrew.deadeye siii es el L3 😁 yo lo voy a comprar para mi cumple 😋 es en noviembre así que es buena escusa 🙄🙊
@mania.gamess jajajaja muy buen pretexto para comprarlo 🤣🤣🤣 (Le atiné entonces xD si es L3)
Glad to know you're finally settled in 😁
@mania.gamess no ma, a mí me encantó, de por sí amo SW el juego está increíble jeje y bueno, menos mal y estás más tranquila y ya se resolvió jaja
Adoro star wars, soy fan de Anakin y por lo tanto de su lado oscuro Darth Vader. Mi fin de semana estuvo genial, el sábado ví ride your Wave una película romántica de anime en el cine, como pizza con los amigos, jugué Kirby en el Switch y me desvele el sábado a las 4 AM por jugar la campaña de gears. Tu qué tal?
Ya se añoraba la frase grosero por las partys xD
Congrats on getting all set up! I'm looking forward to The Outer World's :) that's going to be my next pick up
Not good
@overdosedgaming yeah, finally 🙌
@x_deexter jajajaja 🙊

@gregorywadsworth7446 😞 I hope this week starts better off for you
@mania.gamess Bueno pero ahora ya tienes tu espacio propio, no sé si temporal, pero ahora que ya te quitaste ese peso de encima, disfruta.
That amazing looking hot garbage of a game
@mania.gamess I don't think so
If I see u on line I tell you on Xbox my game tag is gtmaw86
Congrats!! And welcome back! Of course love me some star wars
@mania.gamess October 25th 😊 going to get that over Modern Warfare 🙃
Esa edición esta genial y obvio soy fan jejejeje 🙃🙃 y mi fin estuvo muy relax

How are you liking the ski sword?  I never really used it enough to form a decent opinion.

@apollo.aco thank you, photomodeaddict is a great editor ✨
I really appreciate you crediting me. Thank you.
@novicecreed I feel like the the outfits don’t suit them or the time period, especially if it isn’t their own. The only person I could say I like another assassin’s outfit on is Arno. Not even to sound biased because I love him so much, but genuinely he looks so hot in Shay’s robes— JUST Shay’s robes. Nobody else’s. But of course this is simply my opinion. ~

@dirtgame  how to send you pics like this one ?
@florianlebris I've the same doubt
You don't wait for opportunity to come your way, you create it by yourself. Binary option trade has created an opportunity for you to become financially stable. Invest with @karendonna_34 platform now and gain financial freedom.
@florianlebris guess it's some kinda inner circle stuff cause I can't find any info on that and nobody answers questions like yours
Now i can boast of  making $3200 weekly after several losses,just with my little investment capital of $300 everything turned out for good. I can stop thanking @karendonna_34, it barely a month now since i started trading with her as my account manager and I've achieved a lot. You can make it as well contact her now @karendonna_34
I mean, this makes sense because if you empty your entire mag in R6, you have to reload twice to have max ammo in the mag due to a single bullet being in the chamber while you reload
Sometimes it’s one bullet between life and death

Me playing bo zombies in a nutshell
@onion_fries why did you shoot up a kfc
@sirskirmish you mean siege? That game don't deserve to be called Rainbow Six
Nope, I do it with lmgs so it's worse
@phenderbender23 yea, that's fair
@sirskirmish srry it really left a sour taste in my mouth
@phenderbender23 oh yeah, its definitely one of those games for sure 👌
@bigg_mess.919

Funny that you mentioned that happened to me at kfc yesterday 😂 so annoying am i right
Laughs in Rally Baricade.
(But not tomarrow...)
@shopteese87 I always reload at the worst times when I don’t even need too 🤦🏻‍♂️
@ak.shut *dies while reloading*
Need that extra bullet
I always keep a bucket of KFC chicken near me just to be safe
Kfcgaming shoots black people
@keano.ramos damn you took what I was going to say
This is not funny. This is a serious condition known as Compulsive Reload Disorder (CRD) that effects a large majority of gamers. Disabilities like this that only affect gamers is the reason that we are such an oppressed race.
Especially when you are 98/100
and then get quick scoped :>
This is me reloading on KFC chicken when I don't have 30 pieces
@cordobbbbazo 😳😳😳
That 1 bullet could save your life @kfcgaming
30/31 if you play R6 😉
Never know that 1 bullet may save your life
@katie_alice04 😂😂😂 bo4
Wow @kfcgaming I’ve never related to anything more than this 😂
@_kazi thats me always dying for reloading for no reason
@mat_roberts_ why did you have to tag them in the comment?
@enzo_troka yeaah😂
kfc gaming
Thank you kfc gaming very cool
@it_just_jack dont you fucking dare
@p.r.kyle.g100 or kill another

Nice Hope U Have Cool day 👌🔥
I am also hyped! I want new map😍😍 can't wait ;3
@lammadia it’s gonna be so nice having something fresh to play on. Where everyone doesn’t know the map is the best time with any game.
@abdelrahman.habel thank you! You have a good too dude.
I'm super excited for it 😁👍💜
@overdosedgaming it’s gonna be so refreshing dude! I can’t wait for something new.
Can't wait to see the theme. Once I get a hard drive for my ps4 I'll be back on apex.
@helloghostly I didn't even this of this that way. Now I am even more excited😂🔥
I don’t play Apex 🙈🙈 but hope you have a good time with it 😁
@thorsrighteye lol thanks dude! You’ve got forza to play again lol
@lammadia it looks so cool!
@thephantomkingx the dreaded full hard drive is definitely a deterrent to play some games. I ain’t gotten back to R6S because my Xbox upgrade got a smaller hard drive. Lol
It's first party but still not Mario 😔
A first party to finish would be so underwhelming lol.
Lol who is that supposed to be that though
@ngyes.kody cmon that’s a dead joke by now
Wal-sans Shre-ku-adow is being added? It's Such a shit choice

MY SON. THANK U FOR THIS. I don’t see enough Raichu content 😭😭😭
I LOVE HIM
I’m glad they show Raichu as something other than an evolved asshole older mouse 😭 my baby boi is babey
So what happends to the no pull packs?🤔 just sell those is light packs for sealed collections?
I just want hidden fates heavies
How much for a set of jungle light packs?
Interested in lights too
U crasay
You selling lights
@shinynightfury either that or grade them
so are you selling lights
@britishcolumbiacards same bro
That’s expensive considering they are already opened..... should be like 100 dollars at most dude
@_travstark - nek minet you’ll see the light packs on eBay - ‘I haven’t weighed them but unsure about previous owner’ lol. Not saying @pokemon_revolution_cards would do this (great reputation) but once the lights are sold...... rip off city

Wait, you can play as king boo😦
Fuck dry bowser, king boo is the move
@coltonandjen Ive spent no money in any of them. Mario Kart Tour and Fire Emblem Heroes do not require money to advance in the game.
@newbon_david lol
@coltonandjen yeah that’s mega weird
A Mario game where luigi isn't in the base game and where u have to unlock Mario....
@newbon_david Yet it demands money
@coltonandjen when I play it never demanded money for me is it just you or what
all those characters is gonna go crazy especially luigi and waluigi
Why is Pauline available and not Luigi
@i_have_no_life1552 period
I know right guys, imagine giving a game for free which alot of effort was put into, and then asking people to pay for some things to make profit of it, nintendo is such a bunch of clowns am i right, so stupid they want to make money🤡🤡🤡
@aidspiloot so removing characters is the way to do that, and putting 200cc behind a pay wall ok boomer
@nagolistic 200cc isn't even fun in this game? Plus they are planning to add the characters latwr so the game won't day a minth after release
Waluigi was in there but replaced by jazz mario with his dabbing
@aidspiloot Yeah that’s fine if they add characters, but why remove some in the first place? Characters like Luigi should already be in the game
@umar_b251 Isn’t he coming in a later update?
@nagolistic Luigi is probably gonna promotion for Luigi’s Mansion or smthg
The game is free and they’re trying to make money. Would you rather have pop up ads in the middle of races
yea? because they're all eventually getting released once ranked ends
Why are you posting about MKT?
Can I be honest? I dig that there’s less characters. It feels like I actually have a shot at getting them all
How did the Beta have Luigi but the release removed him?
@mrceeworld Okay but Luigi? You can't have a good mario game without Luigi
This whole game is basically a scummy cash grab game, like Mario Run or Fire Emblem Hero 😒
@ectooffical So that they get the green stuff? 🤑 €£¥₩
Dang, i wish i had time to see you. You look majestic! 😍
@landar486 thanks!! 🌱
@wrightcj21 I don’t have any clue lol
@thegeneticfreek the best take
@emmaskyeward ill have to ask about your experiences when i get home.
you're clearly holding the earth down.. good job too.. keep it up 😉
@emmaskyeward .. looks like maybe your trying to levetate
simultaneously petting two jumping corgis
@_em_aal my dream 😍
@nick_m_drew I would like that

Legit the hardest thing to decide in a pic, wtf do i do with my hands
@emmaskyeward 😊
These are clearly Disney Princess hands
@indomitablejasonw this is the best compliment
@quintoepic I usually just touch my face lol
With your hands you seems some girl or faerie from a manga or anime here...however reeeally nice reading and looking about this! Meanwhile we did a really nice prerelease with 2 cosplayers! 😊
@emmaskyeward lol same! Usually like im thinking about something 😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
@emmaskyeward Ironman impression? You know...when he was trying to hover/fly in the first one lol
The hands looks like the start of a curtsying. Would make sense since you have a dress on. Just my guess
@john3369_77 glas you like it! ☺️

@sir_jeppy thank you !

@imperial_scum thank you !

@cool_toy_pictures thank you ! The sun was just right
the more you research the more you sound crazy to normal people
@tvknowledge no you don't
@paroche.fzs extrêmement rare ? Je savais pas. Je l'ai aussi mais je pensais pas qu'il était si rare. Il fait parti d'un pack GameCube si je me trompe pas
@retrovladyyy aujourd’hui on voit surtout la version US, mais cette version Canadienne est chiante à trouver
Mama que c’est beau ! J’ai eu quelque chose de similaire dans les mains a la sortie de WW dans le pack GC. Malheureusement revendu un jour, jamais retrouvé...
@paroche.fzs je parlais du Mario kart x zelda
@retrovladyyy le patrimoine du jeu vidéo, la recherche , les trouvailles, tout un parcours qui fait plaisir
@retrovladyyy aah! Aujourd’hui elle l’est, ou tout du moins elle l’est devenue du fait des prix démentiels pratiqués par les revendeurs...
@sonofthefatcat merci! Content d’avoir eu l’inspiration de le prendre vu ce que c’est devenu sur les ventes 😓 mince tu te rappelles pas de ce que c’était?? On fait tous ces ventes qu’on regrette à un moment donné hélas 😅
@paroche.fzs Tu m'apprends quelque chose ! Par contre je ne l'ai pas eu dans un pack NGC mais bien en vente classique. Bien heureux de l'avoir du coup 😁
@x.ghostshadoow jolie prise alors ! Bravo 🔥
Je ne connaissais pas du tout, après je ne suis pas expert Zelda donc bon... Je n'est que très peu de jeux rétros ce qui est bien dommage car comme tu dit les prix s'envole ça fait peur. Ma trouvaille d'aujourd'hui le Skies of Arcadia mais surtout mon Golden sun GBA en boite trouvé à 35 euros dans un état impeccable. Et les prochains Pokemon GB et ils vont être compliqué ceux ci.
il existe aussi  un bi pack zelda-metroid pas tres connnu
@prince.actarus alors ça ça doit claquer ! 😍😍
@shakollection c’est sur, ça sera compliqué mais une fois acquis ce sera fait ✌🏼et là tu regarderas les prix s’envoler avec le sourire lol. Il faut toujours suivre ses objectifs quand on le peut, chaque chose en son temps. On accumule du patrimoine
@paroche.fzs bien dit ! 👍👍👍
@paroche.fzs 
http://www.racketboy.com/retro/the-rarest-most-valuable-nintendo-gamecube-games
@shakollection merci! C’est pour ça le moindre jeu Gameboy en loose que je me procure je surkiff, objectifs persos plus plaisir de collectionner, c’est ça le vrai chemin !
@aristerosgeek no, la mia era la copertina tradizione per GameCube
Oh je connais pas cette boîte , je l'ai mais avec windwaker
@skankenstei.n c’est la version canadienne des bonus contenus dans Wind Waker, pas commune du tout 🔥🔥
@paroche.fzs oui j'ai lu qu'après 😂
Je l’ai même pas dans ma collection :c
Je ne la connaissais pas mais bravo à toi pour la trouvaille
@zenhkey plus très courant, il faut s’en remettre à l’import en plus. Mais un Zelda en français hors Europe et surtout OOT c’était destiné pour mon set 🙏🏼🔥
@geekpool_ pas très connue effectivement 😅 merci bien ! 🙏🏼✌🏼
@antor1982 è uguale al tuo ? (Che avevi 12 anni fa?)
Je connais ! Je possède d'ailleurs l'édition limitée de Wind Waker avec ce titre ainsi que le Mario Kart avec ce jeu en plus également 😜
@paroche.fzs ouais chaud à trouver à force malheureusement 👀
👍👍
Aaaah le Master Quest, le temple de l'eau est vachement plus simple ! 😝
@x.ghostshadoow bravo car le Mario Kart avec ce cd est extrêmement rare , principe étrange d’ailleurs d’inclure des jeux Zelda dans un Mario kart 😅
@julien_singer666 ahah la référence ce temple! Au bout d’une bonne dizaine de partie j’arrive à le finir sans trop tourner en rond! 🙏🏼
Je dirais Soleil sur Mega drive. Je l'ai eu à prix très correct, de même que Ristar. Ce sont des plaies à trouver maintenant. Sinon les 3 castlevania sur DS don't je parlais récemment, je les ai rentrés il y a longtemps et maintenant tu n'en vois plus
@paroche.fzs Ahah c'est clair moi pareil
why do people do clutch or kick lmao
How tf did ash die to a Kapkan?! In the actual game she can run through all 5 kapkans take 3 magazines to the face and survive 3 nitro cells just to run into obj and knife kill your whole team.. that's what siege is really like whether or not it's solo queuing.
@1_josh.miskelly_1 Such foolery, I must nut
@damnhercules that's a weird kink, but what ever gets you satisfied is cool 🤷
I plan on getting it Forsure.
All you post is these fake editions lol.
👍
If only Nintendo have these edition major sales

Thanks for the great review! I keep debating about getting this one but I think I will soon :).
@allisonsav_nintendo_queen If you’re a fan of Zelda games and want something uncomplicated, I would highly recommend it!
@inthewildgaming I think that’s the part that holds me up, I’ve never really played Zelda games before but the mix of Mario elements makes me want to play it :)
@allisonsav_nintendo_queen I don’t know a life without Zelda 😂. The Mario elements are very subtle and infrequent.  If you’re mainly a Mario platform lover you could be very disappointed with this one.
@allisonsav_nintendo_queen I’d get the original NES Zelda if you haven’t played that and start there.
bro what the fuck
@toaster.panda that did like 100 damage. What the fuck
what the fuck
@toaster.panda Its just like a sheik combo
@dqv1d8 no, you literally did two things and she died. For a sheik combo you have to sweat
@toaster.panda k 😢
That’s how deadly a dual-reflect can be.

@cyrilviger Good for late COSMOS and early CHAOS. After his EX+ release, he isn't really used.

Cool!
Guys get the console out by Christmas and all will be forgiven!
I hope most off the backers agree
I'm so excited for the VCS!!!!
Can't wait for mine.... And to all you people that slated and doubted Atari doing this.... Ha ha ha ha ha
@etzoy_ Us, too!
I WANT KASUMI NINJA REMASTERED
So Mortal Kombat will be on the VCS
Hopefully the backers will receive soon.. I am like backer 6 hundred and something.
My interest has increased.

Cool game man 🤘 Yeah IG does weird shit I can’t always understand it either. I don’t have this for the switch yet but it’s on my list. Switch is turning out to be a damn fine console for shooters... something I never expected when it came out. They even have a flip grip for it now aftermarket to play shooters in Tate. Pretty neat. Thanks for adding the new tag! 🔥🔥🤘 I’m happy to see new people discover it every day 😁
@turbothunder16 ikr! I mean, it almost has native Tate mode! Last time we've seen something like that the whole system had like... one shmup (a good one though). Switch could have gone in a lot of directions... I'm pretty happy with it, you know, TATE is the right direction after all XD. Uh, and no problem! Your page looks great and with this hashtag you inspired me to post  after several months of nothing... I'm grateful for this 😁
Raiden V is awesome!

Good to see we’re censoring art 😒. What a joke...
Will go see it. This is all media frenzy.
I have my tickets ready
@skinnyist same here! 🙌
@john_the_viking209 yeah man, I don’t consider that a joke at all. Anyone who thinks it’s good that people lost their lives is reprehensible. It was a horrible loss and disgusting act. But if we start to censor art and expression because of the fear of violence, there will be a huge void in this country. Should start banning comics, movies, and other media that revolve around villains because of fear? A lot of interesting and thought provoking stories would not be told. I think we as adults can all understand and agree that the joker is a fictional character who’s evil and cannot relate to 95% of people in this world. This is all just my opinion man. Your entitled to yours.
@djsully20 you’re*
Cant block that facial recognition technology from being used...Sadly, most people know nothing of the technology or the real reason they ban masks. They need to have clear identification of each soul on premises. It's becoming standard at theaters and events nation wide. #1984
Only in the crazy US
I almost always wear a mask...and I'll be seeing it in theaters. 😁👍
@alexsnyder_ we live in a society
@ctjlviking 200 too many but I see your point
What?? Are they kidding us?
@djsully20 this isn't censoring art. The movie isn't being changed. Private companies are setting rules for for people coming into their private establishments.
@g3_industries I was speaking to more of the general idea that’s being perpetuated by the news media. The insinuation that a movie can make people do horrific things. If certain people had their way, this movie would not be shown or would be completely dumbed down. It’s the same argument that violent video games make violent people.
@g3_industries I get your point though. I agree, it’s their decision as a private company and I have no issues with that.
It's been 10 years but I feel

Congrats!
Well done 🙌🙌 I’ve only just started to get in to trophies thanks to @thelittleninja_27 😂
@lealeaa83 slow start but then I really got into it! The ending was a bit disappointing for me because it wasn't anything like I was expecting. But I had fun, especially with the fishing challenges😂
@vapi_foxi they're so addictive once you start!
Woow that's awesome 🔥 Congratulations:)
Awesome! 🙌 Keep up the great work girl 💪🏽🏆🎮💕

@sylwia1007
This picture is gorgeous 💕
😘😘😍😍👍👍
Oh my gosh what an absolute cutie!!!💕💕💕💕💕
Ahhh, u so beautiful 😭💓
@zos_gaming danke 😉🤗
Gute Besserung, hast selbst umgebaut?
@playroomdreams klar! 😎🤗
Hell beleuchtet ist bestimmt nicht schlecht. Kann ich nur nicht beurteilen. Da fehlt mir der passende GameBoy. Meine haben alle noch die original Teile.
Ich fühle deinen Schmerz. Männergrippe ist echt grausam. Gute Besserung ;D Der Gameboy ist echt cool geworden. Hab an meinen bisher leider nur Gehäuse getauscht und kleinere Reperaturen gemacht... An beleuchtete und dimmbare Displays hab ich mich leider noch nicht rangetraut
@windimic ja, ich veränder auch ungern was an den originalen Gameboys, aber noch ein Color zum Zocken musste sein. 😉🤗
@tobiaskremp Danke fürs Mitgefühl 😉. Und zum Display... das hier verbaute ist sogar einfach ein drop in, also sehr easy.  Die anderen Versionen sind auch machbar, aber halt immer bissl tricky und eher ne OP am offenen Herzen. Im Worst Case stirbt der originale Bilddchirm. 😣😔 Ich mag, dass mit den drop ins eben keinerlei Beschädigungen einher gehen, bzw. Man alte Boards noch nützlich verwenden kann 😉🤗
@dasretromaedel Gerne doch, danke für die Info btw. Bleibt das Gehäuse auch unbearbeitet oder muss man da dennoch mit dem dremel oder ähnlichem ran?
Wünsche dir eine schnelle Genesung und Gute Besserung 🍀💚🙏🏽 auf jeden Fall mit Beleuchtung die sieht bestimmt super aus 😍😍😍
@dasretromaedel Jupp, wenn ich noch einen übrig hätte würde ich es vermutlich auch tun. Vielleicht irgendwann mal
Männergrippe ! Das T steht für Tapferkeit
Sieht klasse aus! 😊👍🏻 gibt es so drop in auch für GBA SP?
Nice shot! @dasretromaedel
Shut up and take my money!!! 😍
Krass, kannst Du das auch für Geld machen? Ich hab nämlich zwei linke Hände🤪
Awesome design
Get well soon
Gute Besserung 🍀
@ravendark13th Dankeschön! 😄🤗
@fotns thanks a lot! 🤗
Gute Besserung ❤️

Never heard of this? Is this a legit game?
Is this real?
@isaacvolpe Sadly, no, just a gag by Obvious Plant :P
@beaus_gameroom Nope, but we'd play it if it was. XD
@justpressplaylancaster I figured as much. Still a cool mock up none the less!

I know the gum says “panther” but it looks exactly like the scorpion gun! Great post mate
@armstech_gaming Thanks, the gun is a Time Crisis light gun. It's the only 'prop' gun I've got, so it's probably going to feature a lot. Found it CIB in a charity shop for pennies.

@chris_desa1 dio caro perché minchia ho scritto tredici?

@quellidelfumetto Ahahahahah tranquillissimo, ottimo articolo comunque, teoria molto interessante! Speriamo in un punto di svolta per la S4 altrimenti è la solita solfa
amo questa serie tv...la mia preferita
Sono molto curiosa!!😍😍E ancora spero che SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER che Hopper non sia morto😢Magari è finito davvero nel Sottosopra come molti hanno teorizzato!!🤞
Posso fare una mia teoria? Secondo me non so come il sottosopra divorerà hawkins anche se vedete bene anche il cartello welcome to hawkins è divorato da tipo le "radici" 2 undici non ha perso i poteri con qualche collegamento del sottosopra secondo me perché i poteri di undici non c'entrano una beata minchia con il sottosopra ma è tutto frutto del laboratorio 3 secondo me Sarà ambientata nel 1986 e toccherà il disastro di chernobyl visto che siamo anche molto "vicini" alla russia e secondo me i ragazzi scopriranno SPOILER
@michelemezzaa .  Hopper è ancora vivo ed andranno a recuperarlo

Can we please get a survivor mode?!

@wwzgamer Before Halloween would be nice...🤛
@wwzgamer ok thank you so much, but can you do this if you can? Is it possible for you to do like a actual campaign like the movie is that possible?
Dammit, the only classes I have at max, curse you
There is no known matrix for how many hits the player can stands a normal zombie.
@anthonymxgxd I’m not a developer or anything, just a big fan of the game. I was hoping they would put a mode that plays out like left 4 dead and you just keep progressing through the maps of each chapter. I think that would be cool vs going back to the lobby and having to load in again.
This challenge hurts me 💀 no cap. The hardest challenge so far. Im a slasher main 😭
😍😍
Still boring
Haven’t played it, but I am really curious about it
Is greedfall available for ps4?
@thanas1s_gewrgiou_2004 yes 👍
@falcon.gaming.art then ill buy as soon as possible!
I stopped playing it to play the red dead update.🤷‍♀️
It's an indie game, it has its quirks, its flaws and all. And I'm loving it. I don't know, I can honestly say that it's a good game, nothing spectacular nor horrible. But it has a charm that just sucked me in.
I will waiting that price go down to buy it.
@xybran_digital_art exactly 👍
A little rough around the edges but it hits were it needs to

I LOVE HIM I LITERALLY STARTED CRYING
😍😍😍💚💚💚
I love my special stoner
OMG he is so cute 😍😍😍
How many “celebrities” love their fans like that?! Not many! He treats us more like his friends than just his fans
He is just such an apriciative person I love him💖
It made me so happy to see him happy 😭 I love the relationship we have with him. A lot of famous people treat their fans like yesterday’s trash but we’re his friends ❤️
You KNOW when he screamed “I MISSED YOU” I screamed “I MISSED YOU TOO” back into the screen
OH GOD IM ACTUALLY CRYING
I gave up sleep to watch this whole stream. It was 4:30am here when it ended. He is so adorable! ❤️
That's alotta light spam
@nfnm_king_hydra thanks, assassin class gets that alot but it's okay i don't play orochi much
@ygstoetzelgaming it looked like a basic oro anyways
@nfnm_king_hydra i agree, using assassin class your main offense are your lights and then mix in with a bash and heavy

Have you seen the trailer for the last of us 2 it looks really good
@jmerk1997 yeah I have it do look really good 🎮🔥😱
I wait for croc 😭💚
Left 4 Dead 2 🙏🎉
Heavenly Sword , Killzone series, first Mafia , Lomax. GTA III, Vice City , San Andreas 🔥 wait so much for Medievil 🔥
I think The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion shout be remastered, as well as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider Legend. (Actually... all the Tomb Raider games should be lol)
Sly cooper
How is the demo dude? I'm holding out for the full game!
I was thinking about that this morning and I think Dino crisis would be a great remake with resident evil 2 controls
I would say fallout 3 @itssimplyal because I can imagine what the capital wasteland would look like with slightly better graphics then just adding a graphic mod.
CHRONO trigger
@neledecancq now I feel old 🙌😂
@brave_warrior1333 that's your fav TR game?
@sarokeye you should give the free demo a try 🙌
@mmmempire wtf? How can you remake a game that's basically the beginning of everything? 🙌😂
@kavity.x unfortunately I never played it T.T
@itssimplyal Woooowwwww Im seriously surprised. Where were u 😳😂
@kavity.x playing other games, but I know it 🙌😂
@itssimplyal Yikes man . Its an awesome game . well was . but i understand
Tenchu Syphon Filter & Bloody Roar
@itssimplyal yep. This is my favorite I have nice moments of this. 🏜
I dont know this game 🙄
The real question is where to begin 😂🤔
Sly Cooper
They're already doing the resident evil saga 🤘🎸
Killzone! And prince of persia! 😇
I've said it once, I'll say it again. They remaster San Andreas and it'll break the industry 👏🏻👏🏻
Omg let's say Gun, Golden Axe, Silent Hill, Red Dead Revolver let me think of others lol
The tony hawk games!
Jak and the Daxter would be AMAZING
Socom and manhunt
Dino crisis
GTA San Andreas
Jak and Daxter reboot needs to come through, imo.
I would love to see morrowind and oblivion remastered. Nice shot bro! 🔥👌🏼🎮
1.). The Legend Of Dragoon should be re-released in at least an HD version.  Surprised Sony hasn’t done this yet....doesn’t make sense.  2.). Wouldn’t mind seeing a reboot of the 2008 Prince Of Persia.  It was my favorite out of the series but the story was lacking.  The game felt very “ incomplete “
Awesome Picture Bro 🔥🔥🔥 can't wait already for MediEvil 😍😍😍 Jak and Dexter would be amazing if it would be come enjoy and have a great week 🎮💙🙋🏻‍♂️
Tony Hawk games would be soo sick!! I feel everyone played them 🛹💯
Def jam vendela would be awesome
Need for speed Underground 2
Definitely the Jak and daxter trilogy, I neeeeed it
@ostgostg_ and demon souls
👆Remember to leave a ❤️👆
The original Tony Hawks games from ps1
👇Don't be shy and leave a comment 💬👇
I will be happy to see a remastered of the Tomb Raider the last revelation.

You know I thought about this when I was younger but I was thinking about what if they made a game like virtual reality but it had a pain sensor I thought about this before virtual reality was a thing and it was like a free for all shooter which was really realistic and once you were shot you would feel the same amount of pain as it where the real thing I’d definitely play it what about y’all

ACCURATE.
16 gb at 3200 MHz I don’t need more no point
RAM can't be enough, Google is hungry you know. 🤣
Wowww, threadripper😁
4x16
If you like content just like this check out @desktopgod
Chrome would be so happy
@davideaccorsi That’s incredible. I would love a job like that. It sounds really interesting. Best of luck my friend.
64😤😤😤
🔥🔥🥵🔥🔥🚒
128 gigs of ram
@joshrose___ I wish you the best too! 👍👍👍 If you're interested in CFD, check sharifCFD. They are one of the best insta account for CFD out there and do amazing things! Best of luck to you again!!! 👍👍👍
How much ram do you need? yes.
16 GB 3200 MHz
All the ram baby gimme some of dat mac pro 1.5tb ram oofffff
So much I can install 🤗
16 at the bare minimum
I have 64gb 3600mhz
All of it
64Gb
8gb
HyperX™ 8 gigs 2400mhz
there is never to much ram...
8x8
Wait this beast has no graphics card?😵
Oh myyy 😍
Lovly 😍
@davideaccorsi So it’s a cycle. I would be interested in your line of work. 😂
32 ✌️💫
All the RAM
32gb
@joshrose___ I'm just a turbo machinery consultant. Pumps, fans, compressors and turbine makes, ask me to understand why their product are too noisy, fails too often, or don't deliver the expected performances. Using the CFD and FEA technology you can explore the most complex phenomena and understand all the hidden "whys"... Of course it requires a lot of computations, and that why an extremely powerful PC is required.
More.
Is that 64 gibs of ram i have 8 but it works for me 😂
@bx0xnx3x5 it’s 8x16 and 3200 speed
@gannon_lewis I'm aware...
@bx0xnx3x5 oh thought you didn’t know
4gb
I have 32GB 3200MHz... Space on the board for another 32GB if I ever need it. 👍🏼😛
32 3200 mhz
Have 4. Need 16. Even 8 would do
64GB minimum. 128GB Is my optimal amount.
16 GB
😲❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@davideaccorsi how can u afford that tho 🤯🤯
16gb is fine
I have 2 gig ddr2
64-128 cus i Edit on after effects
Enough to run chrome and my complain about this world..
@davideaccorsi it's not about how you afford it, it's about how you gonna use it? Virtualzation? Home server?
@joshrose___ what can I say? I work, I get paid... I buy computers to work better...
@injustice.ikram numerical simulations
1.5 tb of ram just to run chrome lmao
I need 16gb but I have only 8 lol then also I can play game like "tomb raider rise.. ,GTA V , watch dog 2, fortnite, Apex legend etc "without extnal GPU I have amd a10 7860k
4x4
I have 32GB of ram for a variety of reasons.
256 bc i play minecraft with shaders
Sheesh
It's not about how much, it's about the speeeeeeeeed

Sick
@xalex79 sadly I'm running shadow of tomb raider @70-80 fps (2560x1080 resolution) I don't fell masterrace :(
@xalex79 i can still play a lot of games at 1080p 144fps tweaking the settings so I'd say yes, it's still masterrace
What is that case tho?
Anybody know what fans those are? I like the LEDs
Fire watch. The best game of 2016 hands down
@luisalb3r same but since it's an adventure game I don't really mind. It runs all my comp games well over 144 fps

Genesis did have good games though but nothing beats Mario and Duck Hunt back then. Or the glove lol
Genesis
I really love what you do and your page is so amazing!!! Just curious....Do you need a professional logo done for your brand, business or personal use?

If yes, kindly send a DM.

I bet you'll love my rates ❤😊
Nintendo
Nintendo 💯
I'd say both
@ll_fxze_jxpxti_ll Right on right on! Those controllers are solid
@nerd4gaming_italia hi new best friend

@mecca.eyre LOOOL I had super Mario on it and y'know the one with young mario... Used to play it with my sister's it was sick I miss the old days 💯💯💯
@anonymousxperil 🇨🇭 Switzerland!

@tomas.a.ribeiro glad to hear man, got a few more like this coming out soon
This is pure gas

Ash was so sick then. He seemed like a total noob in Alola compared to his battling days back then. Everyone is so pumped about him winning a championship on an island with a total population of about ten people, with no requirements for entry, and a plain dirt battlefield. This kid could have been a frontier brain. Now those were real battles.

Good luck getting that down
first an second one remind me of tokyo ghoul so i like them a lot lol
@jake_smith1134 the first and second one are the same character just one has the mask on. But they are inspired by kaneki. That's actually the character name I gave her
Kaneki as a female omg 😍
@ikill3dbecka I try
The game is actually really fun.
@lukeblaze89 I've played the demo a few times through already I enjoy it a lot
@ariinys Same
@gage._.brown reach is up there for one of the best halos I agree, fellow naruto fan
@pheneldavis yep Naruto is a good one
@gage._.brown hella good, I know all the story but I’m on like ep400 of shippuden, war arc fillers
@pheneldavis oh shit you are almost there!!!
No no no
Wtf are they thinking, they have to fix this shit before they do that
@serhiuuus try it again tomorrow! It launches with the title destiny 2: New light and that version is free to play with a bunch of stuff to do. But with the new dlc (which is $20 US dollars I believe) there’s a ton of content and changes coming that might have your interest
Will should be replaced with "wants
Marathon was cool... Rott was better, like to see a new myth thing but still loving d2
@owen.peraltaa it’s like gta milk it as long as ya can... still love gta and d2 no hate just it is what it is
@_olivi4r_ time isn’t a bad thing red dead 2 took how long and was amazing
@baransevimsiz not Bungie related but og fps I want a rott game
@serhiuuus let me introduce you to anthem.... I’ll take d2 at any phase
@eversiadred yea but I think they are gonna make a very good game with one of the best graphics of this time
@_olivi4r_ d2 is an amazing game and shadowkeep will be awesome! I’m looking foreword to what they gonna do esp with next gen
No one believes me when I tell them this
@eversiadred yea I know!! I pre orderd the deluxe and I gonna play it today!!
And yea We are gonna see when it comes out if it’s good or noy
#gamer #games #videogames #pc #pcgaming #game #steam #gaminglife #gamerlife #gaming #destiny #destiny2 #bungie
Yooo thanks for the Info!
so will there be destiny 3 tho?
@owen.peraltaa they're planning to support destiny 2 for a few more years so we may just stick with destiny 2 for a while
@ethan_weston__ oh alright thanks
I’m hoping for another Marathon game
Hope they do it better than destiny 2, that shit was boring af
Halo?????
@serhiuuus 🤡🤡🤡
@serhiuuus it WAS boring, if destiny 2 launched like if was now it would've been one of the best games of the decade
@kheggz I played it about 10-15h and I felt like it was just about grinding to take better equipment
@xeno.plataa sorry I don't understand spaghetti
@serhiuuus well then you weren't playing it right at all
@serhiuuus lmao if u dont understand then step your english game up 🤐
@serhiuuus lmao if u dont understand then step your english game up 🤐
I do not think that is the move
@gage._.brown 343 took over ages ago
@pheneldavis yeah but they made such good halos though 😢
Better it will be a good game if the development time is 6 years
Love how you get color into them!!! 🔥
@albinorhinogyno94 Ah, so glad to hear that. Thank you! 😁

У меня тоже был подобный случай...стояла вечером на остановке ждала автобус (уставшая после работы) смотрю идёт парень с двумя букетами роз (белые и красные) и думаю вот бы мне так просто незнакомый мужчина на улице подарил цветы...и не успела я закончить свою мысль, как парень подходит ко мне и даёт один букет, я в полном недоумении, спрашиваю это мне? Он, да. Я взяла букет, сказала спасибо и парень пошел дальше со вторым букетом...меня ни один ухажёр так не удивлял, как этот парень, я даже не спросила как его зовут...но эмоции самые приятные (а с тех пор прошло уже почти 8 лет)

Can u react on my dm pls thank u!
Woah how did you take it?
@divinex.mp4 I turned the map off and I took a screenshot of it off my PS4 and then I just edited it
Ich habe es zwar noch vorbestellt, aber überzeugt bin ich von dem Spiel immer weniger. Vielleicht bestelle ich es sogar noch ab
😁nope werd ich nicht
Schönes Foto 😇 ist dir farblich echt gut gelungen 😌👍
Natürlich und bin sehr gespannt um was es wirklich geht bei dem Spiel
Honestly never been this excited for a game!
😍😍😍😍😍
Ja! Freue mich super auf das Game 🤯

Wait so much for this game😍
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies con este hadoukens infinitos como si no hubiera mañana😂😂👏😊
Un plan para quitarte todo el stresss 😁😁😁😁
Preciosoo!🍺❤️
Siempre apetece echarse unas partiditas al Street Fighter, da igual la versión, son juegazos todos (salvo el primero que el control es una m 🤣)
@llishulsh era demasiado retro para hacer combos 🤣🤣
Muy guapa esa edicion de mando😍😍y del juego que decir que no se sepa ya!!fotaza😍😍😍
@museo_gamer tendrías que ver las otras 3 ediciones que también hay  son 👌.Muchas gracias amigo 😊
Hoy he puesto el Captain Toad, que lo tenia por casa desde que salió, y me lo he acabado en 6 horas 😅😅. Mañana me toca pensar que juego empezar... tengo el Daemon X Machina, pero me apetece algo con otro tipo de estética. Estoy pensando en ir mañana al Game y contar el Ni No Kuni para la Switch 🤔😅
Un juegazo tienes ahi! y ese mando 😍❤️!lucha lucha lucha!❤️
@frakergame yo de ti optaría por el Ni No Kuni, es un remake que promete👌Yo también me lo compraré pero para play 4, me hace ilusión tener los 2 en la misma consola
@retronigga64 ese mando es de lo mejor para cualquier Street Fighter 🔥🔥.Una lástima que no sirva para otros juegos de lucha 😔
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies Guapisimo con akuma en medio❤️😍
@sega_master_system thx😊
Me encantan los Street fighter! Que de recuerdos!☺️☺️
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies yo también lo pillaría para Ps4, sobre todo por que funciona a 1080 y las texturas son en HD, pero uso mucho la Switch en modo portil y me llama mucho poder jugar al Ni No Kuni en cualquier sitio 😊
Menudo mítico juego! Gran título para la colección!
Gran ozion para echar la tarde ♥
@frakergame quien tuviera 6h para jugar😭😭😭. 6h para mi es un juego de una semana 😂
Street figther es vida es recuerdo es infancia es ahora 😜
Mítico este street fighter II, el juego de lucha en SNES por excelencia y la bandera insignia de capcom junto con Resident Evil.

@out4space Mobile WiDoW Lab
@snarky.live  what does the abbreviation "WiDoW" stand for?
Gemidemiyim Karşı Adalardaki Işık’lar Gemiden Geldiği ...
@out4space Star Citizen has several in-game narcotics and drug labs.  WiDoW is one of the more profitable drugs, it comes in big chemical totes.  Jump Town on Yela used to be the place to be as a smuggler in Star Citizen, but now there are multiple drug labs.  You can only buy and sell drugs at certain places in limited quantities and if you get interdicted, police will scan you can give you a crimestat and fine, possibly kill you.  The rewards are high though, a few good drug runs and you can afford a bigger ship.  One loss can reset your account to zero if you're loaded up.
@snarky.live ah OK thanks man. Haven't done any trade yet nor much exploring. So far some kill missions only. Trade is too unstable for me, since the game crashes too often and randomly on my end. Would be raging about a lost shipment in my Freelancer lol. Thanks again 👌☺️⭐

@cristoffer_salinas you still have a chance! 😁
Раритет теперь)
@alexyijedi ну не то, чтобы раритет, но ценник подскочил. А я всё тянул с покупкой. 😁
это же американка? где брал и за скок?)
@alterego_82 офкорс! 😁 Ибей, 39.99, силд 😁
@retromadcap бля, нужно как-нибудь прикупить)) в дополнение к версии на ПС3) это ты после просмотра джизуса рванул покупать?))
@alterego_82 это я рванул покупать как цены поднялись 😢 Она вишлисте у меня за 20-ку давно висела, да я всё тянул...
@retromadcap а цена вверх пошла, т.к. джизус несколько дней назад ролик выпустил, где ее упоминал)))
барыги тут же активизировались, лол
Played it also a few weeks ago 👍
@alterego_82 это как всегда блин 😁
@alterego_82 цена пошла вверх как только её выпили из сторов. Я тут же ломанулся, но всё уже было продано.
@sega_master_system  i played my Steam version recently! I'd like to keep this game sealed 😁
Good job 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🎨

@mini_lisac_cars with the red on, it looks to good!  Will have to get a better pic to show the strip around the desk. Having issues with the back strip of LEDs as working with company to get them fixed.
@borderlands notice anything in this video? 🤘🏻🔥
Those canvas are dope! I want em 😂
@b5_batmobile_rt or are they posters? I can see that the Calypso are posters.
@b5_batmobile_rt they are the things we got out of the diamond loot chest for $250 🤣🤘🏻🔥
@the_sinister_camaro_gaming oh, that's right.
Absolutely love this game.
@daftbubble me too! But it has a bad second half.
@domanickwilliamsgaming I assume you're referring to re playing some of chapter 1 missions? Have to admit it was pretty lazy. Can't remember if that was because Konami cut loose Hideo.
@daftbubble Yeah. And I think it was because they dropped him. Heard the project had money issues to begin with too though, so idk. Could’ve just been a perfect storm. That first half is great though!

My favourite Disney game growing up was Goof Troop on Super Nintendo.
I am thinking about getting some Disney games too.
Aladdin on the genesis is probably my favorite! Toon town as well 😍
@funtimewallace I hear the Genesis and SNES versions are very different 👀
@danevilrobot Haven’t tried that one!
@thatgamernerd They are! Never played the SNES version
Mickey Mania is my favorite Mickey game. Other than that, though probably Toy Story, Aladdin and Lion King on Genesis.
Love the cover art. Aladdin was one of my faves.
Cool 👍 i dont have the left one 😮
@thatgamernerd oh yeah, it's actually a good game, great Co-op if you want to play with a friend and it's also the last Capcom game made for Disney.
Mickey Mania is my childhood JAM. It has some frustrating points that I'm surprised my younger self sealed with 😂
I haven’t played either of these two Mickey titles yet 😅 I have played Magical Quest 2 on GBA though.. fun game 👍
habs noch in ovp wer gern tauschen will bitte melden
Gar keine, bin Nintendo gamer
Das nicht alles geil ist, wo Dragonball drauf steht.
Das andre was es da noch gab war besser battel 22 oder so
Eines der coolsten Games EVER😎😎
Ich hatte damals einen char richtig krank hochgelvlt und an sich wars einfach das spiel
Habs auch noch 😍
And what if they aren’t bad and life has just been tough to them because of bias against robots? :))
@abylightstudios Wait. Are you suggesting that they're not actually the big-bads? Is that cannon? Or are you just messing with me?
@taborektravis they’re big and bad, but who knows why they became that way... :)
@abylightstudios Huh. I guess it's a mystery
@abylightstudios Then again that ambiguity is what makes the game so compelling
Tem mais relíquia ai não?
Claro q lembro....primeiro jogo desse console foi o Tiger Heli !!!!
@weikathnan pior que tem viu.. aos poucos vou desenterrando 😂
@sbranareviews olocooo, me diga quais tem aí?
@fernandometal81 era do helicoptero né?
@weikathnan nem eu sei, to desenterrando literalmente kkkkk limpando um quarto aqui! Sei que tem consoles e colecionáveis, desde de barbies até power rangers...

@morimemyersplz forreal, it’s better to Jump than get grabbed out of it
@boredtasf yeah 😂 I only let them pull me out of the locker if they have franklins , so you won’t lose my item and that’s only sometime 😂
@morimemyersplz feng is too sexy for her 😂

Oh ca a lair sympa 😍
J’ai pas eu le temps d’y jouer encore mais j’ai hâte !🥰
Quel dommage, tous les dark soul like je les voudrais en action rpg ou beat'm'all tellement j'adore les ambiances. Je suis pas assez patient pour les prendre, j'ai besoin que ça cogne vite dans les TPS 😅😅
Stylé, comment ne pas vouloir d'un Steel Book Oo' sympa le cadeau n'empêche ;)
Il y avait même pas le steelbook dans le collector 😂😂😂😂
En tout cas l’illustration est super jolie!
😍😍😍
Vais je craquer. Avec l'arrivé du dernier ghost. De wow et de r6. Sans oublier que je doit finir oninaki en dingue lol... la vie est trop courte pour un gamer
Je suis deg j’ai pris The Surge je savais pas que code veine sortais juste après T_T adieu les boobs 🧐
😂😂
@nonooaya non mais tu kifferais ! Fonce sur code vein mais reste sur wow 😂
@crazymushu grave 😊
@sl0wn_ l'abus...
@cruushwolf adieu les boobs ?? 🤔
@nouvia Le truc c'est que le collector était prévu déjà il y a un an, ils auraient pu le rajouter 😅 m'enfin oui abusé.
@nouvia de ce que j’avais vue sur des lives, certain personnage féminin avais carrément des obus à la place des boobs, d’où la petite blague.
@cruushwolf ahhhhh 🤣 beh comme souvent dans les jeux avec ce chara design. Mais la tu peux choisir ta corpulence et ça joue sur la taille des boobs
@nouvia j’attend du coup ton avis final sur le jeu 👌🏻
Most satisfying sound👏👏

Is there any way to enter this closed beta ?
@shocksgaming You can preregister on the game's page on the Google Play Store if you're on Android. Not sure for IOS but you should check out the Dragon Quest Facebook page.
Android only?
@remstargaming thanks for the info I’ll tell my friend with a droid I have an iPhone sadly
@monstermasterleo As far as I know, the closed beta will be Android only. The full game will be on Android and IOS
@shocksgaming ah, alright. Hopefully the full game launches soon so you can try it out
@remstargaming yes I’m a fan of dragon quest and have been wanting more of it since I played XI, I don’t know how many people necessarily have an Android and play DQ in the West but hopefully it takes off so I can play too
@shocksgaming You'll definitely get the chance to play when it officially comes out. The closed beta is only in a few select places so I'm considering myself lucky that I could even register. It's like Dragon Quest IX so any fan of that game (which there seem to be a lot of) will likely enjoy this one.
Cancerous af
@simo__11547 nah, homie forgot to check his corners.

I run circles around Bloodhound with my sights on him as fast as possible.
@blackjck716  cause on pc it's easy, or at least a lot easier than console
I play cod then come to apex lmao that’s the warmup
I do this with controller lol
I go to skull town
@rai.yugen I play with one every day
@littleemibear 👌🏼🔥🔥 nice content bro
Wtf
Fuck do that with a controller my guy lmfao ya fucking right.
@devinmassey You can’t. You literally have a 1-10 sensitivity scale and use thumbs, you can’t do this with a controller.
@rai.yugen thank you ^_^
That’s cute
Rogue, simple question, have you ever played on console?🎤
@twitchrogue I still think I’ll give you the works rogue
Imdizzy af
Wath a beast🔥
@crilloo no way dude , you play games using your thumbs. PC players chop their thumbs off in order to be the best.
That's why video games are kinda ruined for me
just trying to play once in a while and then I'm put against people like this
I warm up by playing. Thats how
Playing csgo death match before starting apex 😂🔥
Fucking PC players can aim so easily wtf
Dude I don't warm up, I hit one or two games I lose, for a Level 90 Player like me I should have prolly done this since level 1 😂😂😂
Kovaaks
I think you’d make a great dad! You never miss a thing
Damn. That's wild I wish I could snap that fast.
Why the fuck have I never thought of this. Check me out @wanhedra
Getting killed all my games and only winning once or twice that’s my warm up
@davedavinzi
@aarongaspard depends how good you want to play
@optimusparis
God aim @twitchrogue
God aim @twitchrogue
Like this but with a longbow
Practice botching my execution of my theoretically good plays
I pray
I dont need a warm up😤
Fuck a warmup you are my warmup
Nivel experto @lcassj
@nikruizm ese aim viejoooo
Damn...take it easy man 🔥🔥
Simple, land on skull town, best warm up
@hilmi.razali @haziqagira @ekhmal_afif kena warmup sini duluu

@fig_chicken wtf
Wonder how it feels like playing with pros.. prolly heaven and hell.

Were supposed to warm up?
Aimlab with tracking targets
I love u Rogue. Congrats on a great performance at Twitch Rivals. Ur so good!
You unlock your God mode in warm up too. That insane.
You make it look too easy 😳😳😳

He totally deserves that

👌👌👌
I felt like I got slapped
@_smacaroni i'm not sure how
@_smacaroni I might just be very tired
@_smacaroni or just feeling weird
@_smacaroni you can tell cause I fucked up the meme a bit
Spartan ops could have been cool, my favorite missons had to be the valhalla ones
@kreospree vallhalla and hacksaw were cool
@_smacaroni I cannot tell you how many times I tried to get Hacksaw out alive.
@solarknight117 dude never underestimate that
your cracked👀
@xentifyy 🙌
Check out our recent . I think you should grind for us also 🤤
I’m loving the content bro. Do you mind checking mine out I’ve got some decent clips
That’s awesome. I used to have a Pioneer PDP 402 plasma which I had tate until I had an accident and killed it😟
@gradius57300 😮😮😣 Doh! You can get these rotating mounts pretty cheap now. If you ever need one DM me and I’ll point you at a good one or two. Makes it easy to play both ways instead of needing a separate setup for it.
🤯 what a great idea.
@retro_gamer_from_day_0 👍🏻🙏 We do this setup all the time for various clients at work so it was a no brainer. It’s mainly for digital signage but first I saw it long ago my first thought was Tate Mode baby 🤘🔥😂
❤️❤️❤️
@sarethums 😁🤘
What a week. Thank you and @backlog_chan for the awesome #shmupsareshooters week 😍😍 can't believe I beat 2 shooters in 1 week 😜 I gotta get some of this tate going either on the Switch like @ezee_peezy  or on the PC like @prehisto_geek 😊
@bl85gamer thank you for contributing so much to the posts and fun 👍🏻. That’s the nice thing about shooters. You can play them for short bursts when you don’t have a lot of time. Just sit down and plow through a favorite in 30-40. A quick burst of adrenaline. 🔥  Glad you got to beat a couple more. The first time is always special 😂
@bl85gamer the first time you beat a new shooter I mean 🤣
@turbothunder16 sounded dirty for a second but I got it 😜😜🤣🤣
Is Neo Xyx worth getting? It looks like Batsugun but it's Euro...
@neoclassicgamer Totally. It plays fast and smooth and it’s killer in the graphics and sound department. Typical over the ngdevteam stuff. It’s pretty limited release too so it should go up in value. The NeoGeo version is bonkers expensive already.
@turbothunder16 Yeah I would not spring for the AES version, but the dreamcast version seems to be $100+, so I want to make sure it's worth it in case I ever decide to pull the trigger.
@neoclassicgamer I originally found out about it on shmups forum looking for something else. It was pretty well regarded there. It’s the style I like. It plays fast with no purposeful slowdown like some bullet hells and you have a tiny hitbox. There have been times I could swear I got nailed and somehow squeezed through. Feels a lot like Ikaruga to me personally in that way where it’s just smooth. Although the hitbox feels even smaller here!
😀👍 Awesome and well done for the shooters week, great stuff 👏👍
@retroheed Thank you. I’m gonna go lie down now for a while to recuperate 😆
Never play on easy mode 😂
@turbothunder16 😂
@backlog_chan I will use that meme one day. I have it saved awaiting a perfect moment 😁
@turbothunder16 Right?! It has so much potential haha 😂
😂😂🔥🔥🔥I knew that was a big screen in Tate mode, this is sick!  Also your huge pvm that you rigged up to go into Tate pure insanity love it🙌🙌🙌🙌🎮🎮🎮🎮
@seganoid_md Thanks! 🙏  I’m still working on that PVM rig it’s quite a project with limited time. Looking forward to the mechanical stuff being perfect so then I can have fun with the cabinet build. 👍🏻
Yw and understandable👍 you know we all love to see what you're working can't wait to see what's to come🔥👏🙌
Wow, that's fucking awesome lol
😎
@the_chronicles_of_a_gamer thanks dude 🙏  I love that Tate setup makes it so much easier for the vertical shooters without messing with the TV 👍🏻
@jrrrrmee 🙏👍🏻
👍😎🔥
@prehisto_geek 👍🏻🙏 Thanks dude
😊👍
@elektrapur 😁🙏Thank you
Ok I need this style of set up now 👀
Nice turn 👌its tate mode time hail to king baby!!!😎🤘🔥
@videogamebear 👍🏻 It’s pretty easy to do I’m surprised most people don’t. It’s just a special TV mount that allows you to rotate it. Now doing it with a CRT is a whole different story 😂
@segasaibot once you go Tate you don’t go back 😁👍🏻
@turbothunder16 thats right shake it baby😎🤣duke nukem style lol🕹
😂 they were heated
@pastmidnightgames 🎆haha yea 😂
Hahaha 😂😂😂
Dude was trying to pad his stats! What a loser!! 😂

@aldhmey111 صل عالنبي😂
@yasserbasalem يمديك ياخوي البيتا تجربه ويحقلك تلغي بعدها
@s4.g0  اللهم صلِ وسلم على نبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين 🤗

@m_h_alsaleh جرب تشغلها الحين اذا اشتغلت معاك اوكي اذا ما اشتغلت انتظر ليوم ٤ , ما يبغالها ون تو 🤷🏻‍♂️
الديمو ما عجبني فحسويلها سكيب
@x.niea جهازي بلاي ستيشن ٤ برو ولعبت مع اخوياي وحتى مع ذالك لعبه ممله ولا في شي يستاهل الحماس لها ها في حجج أخرى لديك!!؟؟
@yasserbasalem اول مره اشوف احد ما قدر يلغي الطلب المسبق حقيقة 🤷🏻‍♂️
معليش بس ف ناس يلعبو اللعبة ذي بطريقة غلط و بالنسبة للسلاح ترا الاهتزاز زي الاهتزاز الواقعي
😂😂😂😂😂😂 @gamesexit
لاني لعبت البتا ما قدرت ارجعه @gamesexit
سكيب
عيب عليهم عندنا اختبارات
لعبه خايسه ماتستحق احط ريال واحد فيها
لما يجي تخفيض نشتريها
طبعاً .. 🔥🌿🌿
@aldhmey111 الصراحه ماجيت اثبت لك ان اللعبه رهيبه ولا لا بس يمكن مايعجبك هذا النوع من الألعاب
يوبيسوفت ما العب منهم الا فاركراي واساسنز كريد
@silent.gamer.86 دفيجن افضل بواجد قوست ريكون جرافيكس تعبان
اذا نزلت بلس يمكن اجربها 🤟🏿😂
@x.niea هذا شي راجع لي وخاص فيني والجزء الأول معجبني للمعلومية
الكاميرا لوعة🤢
Epic games store exclusive 😥😥
طبعا راح نلعبها ان شاء الله
اش معنا نسخة البلاستيشن اكبر من نسخة الاكس بوكس
لعبتها بس ماش ما عجبتني مره عكس الجزء اللي قبلها و اللي كان جميل بنسبة لي تمنيت يصلحون اخطاء الجزء القديم بس مب راضين يصلحونها مع انها واضحه للاعب زي السياره و الأخطاء الكثيره
سيفون 😂
شلفرق بينها وبين ذا ديفيچن 2 🙄
بعد ماجربت البيتا سويت الغاء الطلب المسبق على طول 👎
@silent.gamer.86 فرق السماء والارض 🙂
العبه جداً جبارهه بحكم لعبتها بيتاً ♥️.
خايسه حيل
@silent.gamer.86 اللي لعبوا اللعبتين بيكتشفون ان فيه فرق كبير 🤷🏻‍♂️
مع اني احب السلسله بس البيتا احبطني شوي
سكيب زي الحلاوه👌🔥
صراحه بالبيتا اللعبه بيض خاصه الجرافكس +الكيم بلي ماحس قدمت شي جديد
@silent.gamer.86 فرق جداً كبير، لعبت قوست ريكون بيتا يوم كامل فرق كبير عن ذا ديفيجن وقوست ريكون الجزء السابق للامانه جداً ممتعه خصوصاً اذا م اخوياك مثل هالالعاب يكون عمرها طويل بس الجزء السابق مليانه اخطاء وخصوصاً القياده جداً سيئة.
سيفون الوحوووووش 🔥🔥
الألعاب كلها صارت نسخ و لصق كلها عالم مفتوح و ما تنتهي الى متى ؟؟؟
اقول الحمد لله اني جربت البيتا لعبه بين انه ينمل منها من اول اسبوع والجرافيكس الي بلأعلانات كذب عادي جدا ولا فيه شي مميز
تورطت في العبه يا @gamesexit
@yasserbasalem تقدر تلغي الطلب المسبق ياصاحبي وترجع لك فلوسها 🌚
ما قدرت ارجعه @gamesexit
@aldhmey111 يمكن جهازك ماش + ماتعرف احد يلعب معك
من لما عرفت ان الاتصال اجباري سحبت عليها
@jordihsplr they are for a limited time😵
@mbm131005 yeah but they will make standard fun
@adam.strit As someone who played HS for 5 years and finally quit after the last expansion, the game gets boring quick after a new release, usually after a month. You find out that hardly any new decks are tier 1 viable and it’s just older decks tweaked with a few new cards. The meta just becomes stale and repetitive quickly and you’re forced to deal with that for months before another expansion comes out.
Hearthstone clasic
@adam.strit Wow clasic is being awesome so they make Hearthstone clasic
I hope this is true the roque ones are cool
Its time to bring my meme decks to standard
No Baku?
Omg y astral communion
Are they coming back officially? Like  forever?
@9ziyuan none of your business!
I disenchanted all of them lmao
I miss N'zoth and rag
Damn lots of favorites 🧙‍♀️🙏🏻
Emperor is a must
Si eso es cierto, no hay ni una carta de dragón añadida en EL AÑO DEL DRAGON.
The only potential I see for "astral comunion" and "renounce darkness" is to fuck up "puzzle box of yogg".
@dannabis.2trayz nah
@an_apache_helicopter there aren't any combo decks a the moment so i think thaurissan is a good choice
Renounce will be fun. I was hoping for the long shot of an unnerfed Raza + DK Anduin and Kazakus
@adam.strit because they need something to keep people playing 🤷‍♂️
@jonttuseni it will be xd
They better refund my dust from the legends😫
My wish mostly for fun and cards that have been Wild for a while: Druid - Darnassus Aspirant, Hunter - Desert Camel, Mage - Arcane Blast, Paladin - Mysterious Challenger, Priest - Raza the Chained, Rogue - Unearthed Raptor, Shaman -Devolve, Warlock - Power Overwhelming or Mal’gannis, Warrior - Axe Flinger
Who am I?
@adam.strit because the meta it's stale as fuck right now lol have you been watching Grandmasters? It's literally the same 4 decks over and over
@lavryshy hahaha facts, especially because everyone will have access to all of these cards immediately
The power difference of these cards is way out of control, renounce darkness and flamewaker?
Infinite taunt rogue!
All of those card are so good they are all gonna end up on a really good spot mage is finally getting some good thing, the class is getting weaker and weaker ( even with the box ) love to play the rogue card on quest as well
Anything but flamrwalkrr
@mr.canabarro yeah it is true that the game is kind of boring atm
Wow! quest rogue will be strong!💙
Renounce Darkness seems very out of place. Bliz said it would be some of the most popular and meta defining cards coming back. When was RD in anything other than meme decks?
They still don't understand how fucking scary Thaurissan is
The current Druid level of power + these cards = 💀
I hated Standard meta.. disenchanted so many cards and started wild
@jordihsplr and now there are coming so cool decks for Standard ffs
Mysterious challenger - ptsd enabled
@shawn2all blizzard is greedy
Do they gift you all?
Where is my mill murloc
Well i hope they give them for free, bc I disenchanted most of them a while ago...
Mysterious challenger = OP
Is it an event thingy, like, "You can play with these cards again on Standard until the event ends" or is it like they returned to Standard for good?
this cards is added to us collection free right ?
Renounce darkness oh yes!
this cant be real theyve just chosen the busted cards
@monxofp they said they will give free uncraftable copies
Holy shit no flamewaker pls no its going to make cyclon mage absolutely op
@pcherfs event
@monxofp they do actually! But its just a "copy", so you can't disenchant it
Ight, gotta stay in wil and not touch standard
Oh god, sylvanas is very goodbut its also super annoying and it used to be in almost every single deck.. Let's hope it wont be this time..
Adding kun when a quast druid is teir one... Kinda scary
@anil.berkant.ulusoy I hope so but probably not
@anil.berkant.ulusoy yes vut for only limited time
@anil.berkant.ulusoy yes they said you get it for free
@wysoon98
@gabrydinoz for limited time only
Why are they doing this ?
Dottor 7 in standard again!
Deathrattle rogue let's go!
Anything but emperor pls
@adam.strit for fun 👏
Label says Frogger... Is it really Qbert?
Sorry my bad, it's Frogger!
Awesome! 💙

@odin_h594 the majority of it's free now but ig blindly bashing a game rather than trying it id fun too
@tucker.213 I did try it and I hated it
@odin_h594 you just said that you weren't gonna waste your money on it
A friend
@ig.wibbily_wobbly_jellyyyyyy no they wont bungie never owned the halo series and it's highly unlikely that they will go back to it since they had such a negative experience with xbox
I’ll still be playing destiny
NONONONO DESTINY ONLY!!!!
@zach173856 yeah 5 was bad. Especially 5 though
@lincolnjustin1028 I really struggle to take you seriously because you support school shootings 😂😂
@garrett.howardoooo learn something new every day ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ either way it doesn’t seem like the games gonna come together in 4 years anyways 😂
Dude there's still 5 more years and also look at ubisoft they're making alot of games and fixing siege the division and other games so it's fine if they separate destiny's fixing team from other games
@kadendudley what do you mean by come together?
@garrett.howardoooo like I know the pyramid ships are gonna be in the third disc game once that’s released, but I feel like destiny itself as a whole isn’t going to be able to all connect together to make a complete and satisfying  ending to the game series within the next 3 to 4 years. Like with all the lore and stories that are just starting to become important, I feel like it’ll take longer than the allotted original 10 year timeline for all the storylines to come together and all relate back to the main point of the game which would revolve around the life of the traveler
@twiztidkorean_ they did own it, they sold it to 343 industries
@kadendudley i cam agree to some extent. Bungie have created SO MUCH LORE for this franchise. I feel as though d3 can finish it all story wise. I mean the pyramid ships are on the brink of our solar system and the traveler has cracked. I suggest watching byfs hypotheses video on the TRUE origins of the traveler and the pyramid ships. The 4 gods, 1 having a bastard child ( the traveler ) the traveler stealing the power to create matter etc. It ties destiny together imo with its origin
@garrett.howardoooo yeah, there’s definitely a lot to put in, and if d3 is as promising as it sounds with bungie working on it exclusively. It just needs to have a lot more content than the other games, but with bungie taking the wheel themselves, hopefully shadowkeep shows that they can really do with d3
They said destiny was supposed to be a 10 year franchise which makes sense to move on
@zach173856 By the time its 2025 their company should probably be large enough to support another title, but destiny should be their main focus still.
Say sike right now
@odin_h594 ah shit another clown 🤡
@lincolnjustin1028 You are literally saying that a game is bad because there’s no trails.
You are not just a clown, you are fucking whole circus
They will most likely make a new halo game I’ll tell you that.
@simplecarrotfarmer have you made it out of the 4th grade yet? Still wondering why you're not paying attention in class right now....
@harrison.cordill Destiny came out 2014, that would be 11 years
@tuckerstore_ I’m aware, I’m saying they could continue beyond 10 years without activation
@lincolnjustin1028 LiCoLnJuStIn1028
Destiny is ending in 2024 or something like that it makes sense to move on
I'm confused as to why this is a bad thing.
Excuse me what? They best not be goin for that I need my destiny 3 first
Is this confirmed?
That’s what halo players said when they heard about bungie making destiny
@goonsley I bet we'll get destiny 3 in 2021
@ianjagz_18 I hope it’s farther out than that tbh. I want it to be a game that bungie really puts their all into. Having shed the shackles of activision, they’re free to take as long as they’d like (so long as it’s within their budget). I’d be upset to see it that early tbh
@the_nice_otachi have you played recently?
I’m graduate 2025 lmao 💀
They should expand their company but still have destiny as their main focus
@agent00donut yeah bungie made the best halo games so good halo 3 was my favorite 5 and 5 were bad
Man, décroche sérieux...
@tucker.213 no I don't waste my money on nonsense
Well they already destroyed destiny. Last time that was good was the taken king
There is a lot of room for aggressive expansion🤡
@jonas_art03 real
@kadendudley that contract was ONLY under activision
Theyll probably have a Destiny team and a team for the other game
@lincolnjustin1028 you see chief, that’s where you’re wrong 😎😎
@simplecarrotfarmer do your parents know you're on social media? Lol
@lincolnjustin1028 Well have you played Destiny 2 lately?
@lincolnjustin1028 *rise or iron*
Wasn’t the contract tied to activision and now that they’re gone so is the 10 year plan?
Please
Facts
@flogiz no. From the moment they got rid of 3v3 elim trials....the game lost my interest. Me and my buddy are straight competitive players and we used to run elim through the week and trials every weekend doing carries back in D1. The game went downhill for me after they got rid of that. There were no "plays" to be made anymore in my opinion.
@lincolnjustin1028 you do know destiny is mainly PvE right?
@agent00donut zey do
@chillingpw yehh right now it is. But pvp used to be badass back in d1. Thats why im saying i dont like the game anymore.
Destiny bad to me so please bungie MAKE SOMETHING GOOD!?
God forbid a company makes another game 😂😂
@lincolnjustin1028 UnIvErSiTy Of HoUsToN 🦀🦀
@lincolnjustin1028 i feel like destiny was always more PvE oriented my guy
They need to go beck to halo and make it good again
@agent00donut they don’t own halo anymore
What if it’s a secret destiny prequel which makes a larger destiny universe by having spinoff games such as the likes of the Nasu-verse
@tristen_._hill thats y they need to go back to it
It's a cayde 6 porno wym @destiny_thememe
Fake news or real ?
Destiny would be long gone by then considering it’s only a 10 year project, unless they’re able to extend it
@tristen_._hill just buy it back

PS4. Easily the most durable controller I've used.
@khai.theguy durability is super important!
Definently the mouse because it’s clearly quality
Mouse definitely but not that one
@momenalattar good choice! Which brand do you like the most?
@det_tjalfe gaming with a mouse just feels right! But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy using a controller occasionally...
@saladchefs i use logitech (g502) and a rapoo v20 pro
All are great, but I like the mouse for fast camera movement
@momenalattar great brands! I’m a Logitech fan myself
@saladchefs a man of great taste i see
@saladchefs hehe
@momenalattar likewise my friend!
@kex312 Agreed. Its one of the greater perks with using a mouse!
Definitely Xbox or mouse. Two superior tools to hold in one singular hand that maximize your gameplay

👌🏾🖤
Thanks for having us!
@conservative_coffee can you change fate ? No.....can you change fate of a story? It depends on the writer and the devs in GearBox and 2k whether or not the story is canon....maybe maya is still alive but on different universe...but siren-less
Lilith didn't know what to do and was worried about Roland....heck, Even wanted to flirt with Roland if you go and do one of her missions in bl2
@conservative_coffee jack knew what would happen and got the knowledge of the warrior and saw a siren charging the vault key....jack Was the only person to know what would happen and he tolds angel about it too....Thats why she warned Lilith not to go There
Every human being is prone to make mistakes....either it was fake or real.
@conservative_coffee and don't you dare talk about "Perfect Beings" as there is no such thing as "Perfect being"
@conservative_coffee And why do you think that Roland got carried away? The mission was over and they didn't know Jack have a cloacking device and killed Roland....How do you kill Something you can't see? And he was talking to all of bl2 vault hunters
@conservative_coffee pack up your facts before opening a controversial subject here okay man?
Maybe maya will "come back"like yoda 🤔 the book of storm
Do it for the lulz. Thats gearbox's story plan. I'm not a fan of their pandering emotional trainwreck of a story. Girl power I get. I don't really need that commentary in every media outlet though. Tone it down a touch.
@rootjail I said Maya was awesome! In my opinion she was the better siren at the time.  What's wrong you can't read English. Awesome does not equal perfect, does it.  I hate when people take other people's words out of context to further their own beliefs and agendas simply because they cannot stand the fact that somebody has a different opinion than they do.
I will find it
OMG WERE GONNA HAVE TO TELL HIM NOOOOO
If this dude ain't in the dlc ima be mad
Poor krieg💔

Maya* I don't feel to good mr stark
MY HEART HURT IN HALF AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

@der_rauchritter 😭❤️
“i’ll be back, i promise” well that was a fucking lie
@jason_winnnn big rip
I HATE Ava! Her fault Maya died. Borderlands should have killed off Lilith.  Lilith is credited with all former vault hunters accomplishments. She was captured after disobeying explicit orders, and contributed  to Roland's death, by averting his attention. Maya was awesome,  Lilith sucked! Ava's disobedience caused Maya's death.

Are you looking for a supplement to your current income?

Maybe you’re stuck in the rat race and it doesn’t pay enough?...Maybe you’re retired and you need more income?

Bitcoin trading has been my main source of INCOME. When I earned my first $12,500, it was a dream come true! I ended up getting laid off and to be honest, I’m doing better today than I had been at my job, if you’re interested I’d recommend @trade_with_scott_00
I first had doubt when i registered and invested money in bitcoin trade with Mrs marie but finally I find it real and legit after my profit has been sent into my Bitcoin wallet in just 5days of trading. Thank you Mrs @earn_with_marie_pier
 for guiding me through.
Ormai è diventata grande😍😎😂
I have been extremely great since i started trading with Marie_pier and i have earned alot of which I'm very happy of. It all started with doubts but now I'm a living testimony of her good works. You can contact her via @earn_with_marie_pier
Do they come in lenses cus I already wear glasses

J'ai adoré le Remake de Resident Evil 2. Et le steelbook est super 😊
Ce n'est pas ma tasse de thé mais il en faut pour tous les goûts. 😊
@shakollection Ce n'est pas ce que je préfère non plus mais cela ne me dérange pas pour autant.
@gamergirl.fr Tu as même eu la force et le talent (Surtout !) pour le platine 😁
Pas encore fait, il est sur ma liste de futurs achats 😊 le steelbook est trop beau 😍
@_pixel2.0_ Je l'avais eu à un bon prix sur un Amazon étranger mais je ne sais plus lequel 😅
@x.ghostshadoow lol moi perso je suis en total flip 🤣
@x.ghostshadoow C'est le Dlc le plus embêtant mais sinon c'est un platine accessible avec du courage 😊
@x.ghostshadoow Amazon Allemagne peut être, ils font souvent des grosses promos sur les steelbooks 😍
Je n'y est toujours pas jouer non plus 😱 mais c'est vrais que ce steelbook et superbe 😍🏆
Oui RE c'est la base 😍😍🔥 ! Par contre je suis jaloux de ton steelbook 😭😅😍 !
Il m'attend sagement chez moi depuis sa sortie mais je l'ai mis de côté pour d'autres jeux hélas 😅😂 Parcontre je n'ai pas pris la version avec le steelbook qui est très beau au passage 😉
FAAAAAAAN FAAAAAAAAN 😍
❤️
Love the steelbook 😍
Super le steelbook 👍🏻 j’ai pas fais celui sur ps4 encore. Cela dis les Resident evil j’adore 🤗

I'd scan it for radiation
Woww esto si que es viejo. Pena que esta todo quemado. Hermoso para un museo 👏
Wow amazing
So cool!!
Probably needs software updates to get online 😝
Can’t wait to see it power up
😢
@sanfurgoalejandro tengo que limpiar todo y buscar el teclado original. Puede ser esta funciona😂
Nope
Io no...
Mi sono modernizzare vado sempre a leggere il nome😂
Ma Dio parla di me
No
Nope
Io no
anche ESC
Colpevole
Esatto
Select?
no
Esatto
Si
Io ľho sempre chiamato start e quando lo dico ai miei amici loro mi rispondono così "aoo fla nun ho capito che tasto" 😭😭🤣
Domanda...Qualcuno sa quando esce la ps5?
Mai chiamato start
Maddooo esatto 😱😂😂😉 ma anche select
No
@francesco_granza select?
Ma anche quelli della Xbox li chiamo start e select 😬
Nnnnnnnoo
Sbagliato io lo chiamo option :P
No
Eh già
All'inizio si ormai no
No
No
Ok ok mi hai smascherata
Sono ancora abituata all'xbox, un amore che mi ha accompagnata per 10 anni della mia vita
@carlomisserville anche io
@veecho.63194 ah ok pensavo di essere l’unico depresso a riguardarmi le clip😂😂
No
😅
No ma chiamo il tastone centrale tab
No
Nha
Ma solo io lo chiamo oppetionns
no
No perché è appizzato leggermente in modo diverso 🤔
😂😂
Chiamo così anche quello della mia X Box One!
No
Io no
No
No
Vogliamo parlare di quanti sono che non hanno mai chiamato il touchpad con il suo vero nome?
Apparte i 2004 e 2005 che sono cresciuti con la 4 praticamente
No perché altrimenti quando devo spiegare alle altre persone che non conoscono un joistick non capiscono che tasto devono premere
Ao premi start
@_._3xal_._ io non c'è l ho
@nw.crazy stupido babbo che giochi da xbox
@_._3xal_._ zitto
@nw.crazy no
Oltre a questa abitudine, abbiamo quella di premere tremila volte un pulsante anche se basterebbe una volta sola😅. La scienza non è ancora riuscita a spiegare ciò 😅😅
Si e i mi correggono sempre
Eh giá
Chi altro, oltre a me, chiamava il tasto cerchio ⭕️ con appellativi come ‘tondo’ oppure ‘Ó’ 😂
No
Nemmeno sapevo che c’era anche perche da me c’era scritto direttamente start 🔨
Perché? Si chiama options?
Io sono rimasto alla ps3, per me il tasto options non esiste
Verissimo 😂😂😂
RESTERÀ PER SEMPRE START
Mi pare ovvio.
Io chiamo start il tasto al centro grande
Esatto hahahahahhahaahha
Oddio si😂
No
Caxxo è vero
Verissimo a volte pausa😂
Ho Xbox...
No
Avendo la PS3 non ho questo problema: stonks
Ps2
Verissimo 😂
Verissimo😂
Yes, start e select
hahaha
Nope
no
Verissimo
No
All'inizio sì, poi ho cominciato a far giocare mia sorella più piccola che non capiva e ho dovuto abituarmi ahahah
Io HO IL TASTO START ANCORA
non siamo mica caduti così in basso
No
Per me è Options é Select🤣
Bei ricordi
Eh si...
Non sapevo nemmeno che adesso si chiamasse options😂
No dico options
Mio Dio ma parla di me
@niccolo_ss.lazio_ no
Esattamente 😂😂😂😂😂
Il tempo passa ma start no.
Hahaha 😂
@shedeys_s hanno semplicemente cambiato il nome, adesso select è più utile visto che ha anche le funzioni touch. L'unico tasto aggiunto è il tasto share (che è molto utile a persone come me, che riprendono clip per poi andarle a riguardare nei momenti di noia)
Io lo chiamo il bottone piccolo a destra easyyyy
No hai sbagliato hahahaha
Esatto hahahahahahaha
No
Sti tasti non hanno senso. Cambiarli è stata una cazzata che non perdonerò mai a Sony
No
No
No
Io lo sempre chiamato pausa
fino a 1 anno da
fa
@emiliano_bocchetti no
Vero😂😂😂
Ormai sono abituato a option
Dio parapleggico sono andato a controllare
no
Quoto
Ehm io lo chiamo options
io dico sempre: "premi il tasto oppition" ahahahaha
Ahhhhh
Io no perché ho la x
Si
Ovvio
Start e select tutta la vita
All'inizio
Ovvio
Forse prima, ormai touchpad e le options sono la quotidianità
Vero😂🤣
😂
Strano ma no(forse sono l'unico )
E  di SELECT non ne parliamo?
😂
Nope
@affa_with_love per registrare lo schermo del gioco
Oddio sii
No
@aleaba15 era una battuta
@affa_with_love ah rip😂 sorry
No
Colpevole
Quanto vero😂
Esiste un tasto options ?😂
Per un po si😂
Mi spiace ma ti sbagli
😂
A vita!!! 😂 😂 😂
Ci puoi contare😂😂😂
Lul lol verissimo anzi ora sto iniziano ad abituarmi
Start tutta la vita
Hahahhaha
@ma_veh_vezz
Beh, no mai chiamato così
Assolutamente no
Esatto
si cazzo quello rimarrà per sempre start
Mi pare ovvio😂
Eccerto
Verissimo 🤣
Ovvio e l'altro select
Io share non so cosa cazzo sia
Oddio si
E invece no
✔⬆️😂esatto
No
Ah perché si chiama options??
Ma dai... si chiama options adesso?
Vero
no
Vero alcune volte scambio il nome😂
❤️

@giovani1.c ye

Wym every one who plays gta are kids
Both pills 😛
Why Fuze?
@guero_el_7 That's all I wanted to do though. 😢
@giovani1.c Yes.
Yeah because they don’t want you shooting kids
Minecraft: 1 day.
Who didnt notice
Oh naw i hope ur being sarcastic talking bout “ever noticed there are no kids in gta” 🤣🤣 yea I think everyone noticed that like 5 years ago
Yep
Because Rockstar doesnt want the Players to kill children
There is a secret website in gta with an car accident were a whole family, also children, was killed
@stoned_gamer64 no.
Yes because its illegal to kill children in games in many countries
@joniheleniuss you’re cramping my style g
Check out my high gaming YouTube channel. My new video is fire(don’t watch the first one). Link in bio
There is but only voice actors cuz I was driving in the Bugatti on story mode and a kid said”look at that mom”
There can't be children
Nahi😂😂😂
@petik404 there is one picture of a kid
There are kids
Would you kill a child?
Of course there are no children
Yeah because they're not gonna let me fucking snipe a toddler
Blue pill (DC)💁🏻‍♂️❤️
Red pill
I love marvel and all, but i also like dc. Recently i finished the flash and im near the end of green arrow, and they are really good shows. So its a meh for me for whos better
They don't want us to kill kids in the game that's why, no roleplaying Anakin
I’m gonna take the blue pill

The only thing I remember about this game is the Korn song, haha.
Nectar, right? A take on the universal soldier type story but the roid rage aspect more developed in to the story... I never got far in this one but I heard about how the story goes, I'd go back to this one if I had a long afternoon to spare...
@stevie_plays_games Yeah, it was definitely "nectar" and very stupid. 😆
I only played the demo for this game. The whole Korn song fiasco was hilarious on the old The HotSpot podcast at the time!

If bloom wasn’t in the game of course it would be a aimbot. If you have ever played a game without bloom *bam* op for both console and pc even if we do t have aim assist. Idk why they like this they can do everything we can 1000 time better
it takes skill to use aim assist (you need aim practice to have good aim with aim assist)
@noebro_ . Play on console, if you do, play without aim assist. Ain’t to easy is it Hugh
imagine still playing
I’ve played on pc and console and to be fair, there’s no difference with aim assist or not. Don’t @ me pls I’ve argued with at least 5 different ppl today over nothing so ya. :))))))
He has good targeting
@iitscharli_ gang gang 🤜🏻☝🏻🤲🏻🤟🏻🖐🏻
Tim does realize that controller player still have to move their joy sticks when they are in air right
Its not that good
@cookie_mason_2_8 😂😂😂
am I good for 1 month on keyboard and mouse?? 🐐
Why don’t you shut up you pc players and play the game lol .. controller gang 😈🔥🎮 @im_timthetatman @ninja go cry 😭🤣
Well I’m a bot and no matter how much aim assist I will miss
@traviscantread mobile
No it isn't. People don't hit shots because of aim assist it's because they have been on controller their whole life. All aim assist is, is less bloom on shots
@aurioal 100% agree with you
They are mad because they think aim assist is like aim bot but just imagine controller players with no aim assist we will be bots and they have scroll wheel reset which is not problem I don’t care if they have better editing speed
@noahg_04 so use a medium sensitivity
@fortnlteclips facts
No it make it fair
@he_he_boii not wrong
@xxdarkhunterxx21 No good pro player is good because of 2 or 3 edit binds. I dont use them. But Nickmercs is good only for his aim because of aim assist. It takes more practice to edit on console just like it takes more practice for pc to aim.
@xxdarkhunterxx21 and in the end whats more op, resetting your edit fast or shooting someone in the skull with a tac smg
Only console players will understand that pc players are way over dramatic and that Nick merks was literally right next to the guy I have Aimasist and I hit like only 3 shots every mag they are just sad they  don't have it but sorry pc players you don't need everything team console 💯💯💯💯
Ninja is over dramatic
Console
That’s only on pc tho
Aim assist isn’t working for me idk y can someone help me
yah deadasss still fuvking play this game
I don’t wana play against dam keyboard
Man I still miss lmao
@noebro_ pc player
You should grind for @tierggs !!!!!
bruh aim assist is not that bad if u get beamed how bout you pc bots build for protection and stop complaining like some 2 year olds over a virtual game
y’all aim better than ours just bc y’all got arm room and 101 keys on your keyboard meanwhile us controller players doing the same shittt y’all do on 2 analog sticks
How must console play than.  you GUYS can build faster with Mouse and keyboard 😑 thats aim assist
@matteoforia bc using a mouse is more enjoyable and we have been using it for years, we dont want to just throw all that hours of muscle memory training to the garbage
@mambafn I’m bad at math🤦‍♂️ Nvm😂
Every little thing they add you still have to complain like just quit the game and move on to something else childish wankas 😂
as a controller player, i think aim assist is a little op and they need to nerf the snap to feature, but it’s also good and you don’t realize how much it helps as a mouse player
@aurioal you’re*
@jorr.fn you don’t get it for free, aim assist isn’t the only thing that makes control players good. i’ve seen controller players with terrible aim. but aim assist just helps the 2 whole inches controller players had
@x.hxrry.x14 👌👏😂👊
@iitscharli_ u know it
Pc players use basically the same amount of buttons as a controller player does. Controller players can build just as fast. And it is easier to aim on console. If anyone wants to debate dm me cuz its hella broken.
Follow me I have no followers
@kingjekar ikr
Theres no buff, my crosshair is still the size of a fucking truck and I dont hit shit while standing still, I also have the white dot on the guys fucking face and everything misses, it's as if my gun shoots peas and corn
@lysekyt WTF man PC players use 2 or 3 edit binds while controller players use 1 and u are wrong it is easier to aim on PC cause u use all your hand
Quit playing fucking fortshit it’s so ass switch to rainbow
Seems like they're just blaming other people for things they have with no actual argument
I saw a homework folder in his pc
Anyone can laser players with the tac smg
Stop fucking moneing and go to console then
No
New upcoming fortnite team follow @teamsharpened to keep up and use #Sharp100rc to get Noticed 🍀👀👀🍀 sorry for self promotion
@aurioal and they jealous of the nerds on sticks
Remove it completely. They add skill based matchmaking but still no skill
It’s even now!!!!!!
@mambafn you just copied @aurioal
@mambafn damn right!
Even if ninja had aim bot he's still a bot
Imagine playing Fortnite still
@deathatwork its actually the orher way around... if Mnk players were mad, they’d switch over to controllers. Controller players are mad bc they can’t afford MnK 🤣🤣
They switch to controller you cry babies, it’s that easy
@noebro_ I said it first😐
@gabriels_tocool cant afford? Lmao you a 🤡
@deathatwork says the guy who plays controller on pc 🤡🤡
@gabriels_tocool yeah and i can afford a mnk thats why you a 🤡🤫
every pc player doesn’t realize air assist doesn’t help much i have to have super good aim to do that
Ninja sucks😁
@kriyohs97 yeah the aim assist is too strong when you're aiming like I think it's annoying
@noahg_04 yea me too it’s not that op anymore they buffed it a lot
No is not💀
For Some People Not For Me
@fortnlteclips controller
Hey pc players (💩) stop complaning you guys have like 30 buttons on ur keyboard and mousr combined and you have ur wjole wrist to aim with

Yup
If you quarrel, why dont you use controller??
No it’s not, if there is weapon BLOOM then it should stay
@aurioal and they jealous of the nerds on sticks
It’s funny because people complain about aim assist is op or it’s aimbot; obviously haven’t played COD
@aurioal there is aim assist on pc as well
New upcoming fortnite team follow @teamsharpened to keep up and use #Sharp100rc to get Noticed 🍀👀👀🍀 sorry for self promotion
Aim on PC (mouse and keyboard)will forever be better than any plastic stick with and without the “oP aiM AssISt” i’ve played on controller for many years and just switched to PC. My opinions are those you just read.
It’s not a buff at all for anyone that’s used controller since season 1 they can’t testify too that it’s almost been removed with this update if you try to L2 spam it doesn’t work it won’t lock onto opponents anymore and they took edit aim assist away so we have no help on editing too by far the worst update for controller players especially since people have complained about controller players aim assist since smoke bombs were in the game and when epic noticed that they nerfed it and consistently nerf it till keyboard players stop complaining that they died to a controller player like just hit your shots more and don’t die 🤷🏼‍♂️
Lol controllers with the biggest handicap ever 🤡 remove aim assists
Mbn cause mine is like tgat
@mladilovac naravno
@aurioal you’re*
@aurioal why should mnk players have to grind to get good aim when controller players get it for free 😳
@jorr.fn Scroll wheel is op? you have many macro programs as well as 15 working buttons on a joystick and no skill to aim and paddle/attachments with various sensitivities but a plastic mouse and keyboard is op? Your just trash, grow up virgins
@aurioal i don’t even know what u just said homie 😂😂😂
@jorr.fn lmao
No, let's just tell ourselves that we've got better 🔥💩
Okay, the pc players will stop crying🙌
?? Lmao Aim assist got a Nerf😂🤦🤡
0 bloom
Pc players are just mad that they don’t have it when on pc u have like 100 keys and we only have about ten controls
MnK Players Mad Af Rn 😂😂
I'm a controller player and I think it's way too strong
@mambafn controller gang
@mambafn mamba with the facts
Bro if anything it’s harder to hit people with the ar now 😟
pc players act like they don’t have 2,000 buttons and a whole arm to control . 🤡
No because pc have scoll reset and 3 bind to edit fast
All you PC players can suck my right stick!! Controller Gang 🎮😈🔥
NO
Aim assist is op? you have unlimited aim training programs as well as  101 keys on your keyboard and your whole arm to aim and 3 edit binds  with scroll wheel reset but a plastic stick is op? Your just bad, grow  up losers
I promise my aim has gotten worse since the update. Any tips for controller settings ps4?
@aurioal 😐
@iitscharli_ 😈
Eryctricepts
no
@dorijan39 aimassister Curky lmao
@aurioal fax
i cant do this even on console
Lololololol @dannyray10 @ninja @im_timthetatman aim assist isn’t at all like this while continuously moving, building, editing, and doing all the other functions against high level players. It takes skill to be able to use a controller and even get close to aiming with one thumb just like it takes time and skill to use KBM. KBM players are still better at fortnite all around
@aurioal fuckin thank you someone had to say it quit people need to quit complaining
@nick_82woods 😤😤
who’s better: controller players or mouse and keyboard players? 😳
No it’s not
@fortnlteclips controller gang!!
Kbm is still alpha
@fortnlteclips controller 😳

Aim assist is op? you have unlimited aim training programs as well as  101 keys on your keyboard and your whole arm to aim and 3 edit binds  with scroll wheel reset but a plastic stick is op? Controller gang or no gang😈🎮

I love himmm so much in Nier! To me, i prefer Nier then automata, i felt nier story and characters are alot more in depth and more emotional for me.
@willowistinct I feel you 😭 so many tears💔
@mtoytrooper true! That's exactly what I noticed playing Automata. What makes it a lot more in depth were Emil, Devola and Popola and different Easter Eggs. Emil is so unforgettable tho😭

Wow! Well done!😊
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 TEACH ME, SENPAI!
Damn impressive!
@lindsaylovecosplay will trade foam tips for makeup tips 🤣
@warheartcosplay thank you 🙏
@coregeek thanks man! Your videos helped me figure out airbrushing so some credit is owed to you here too!
@baldguycosplay That’s great to hear! Thank you.
NEAT. Let's talk about that penguin art though 👀😂
@jsythecostumes Oh! That! That’s a great story! I was recently cheated on, and I sat on my studio floor, half-drunk on whisky and fully-caffeinated and I used a bunch of leftover scrapbook papers that were ocean themed, glued them together chaotically, then drew several penguins. The morale of the story is that relationships may come and go, but penguins are fucking forever!
@baldguycosplay Sounds awesome to me! I'm trying to do Fantasy Momo from MHA, so I need to start practicing more! 😊
Looks straight out of a comic
I love that wood texture!
Honestly I’m so stoked to see this whole thing together. Every time you post something new I feel like you just keep getting better and better!
Looks awesome.
@bodydoublecosplays i was wondering how i would like making a second Torbjorn and it’s been really fun actually feeling confident with the build since I’ve ‘done it before’ and seeing how much cleaner and structurally sound it is compared to the first. I’m really happy that comes through in the work. Thank you 🙏❤️
@baldguycosplay this response story was an adventure Holy shit. Penguins are love. Penguins are life.
Approved! Get that man a pint
Extremly awesome! "Hård wørk pays off!" 💙
Cheers I love this.
DUDE!!!!!!! I can’t even with how badass this is! 💯🙌
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 Heck ya! This is looking so amazing!!!
Wow! 😲👌
This is amazing 🙌🏼😱
It turned out great!!!
So outrageously cool. You’ve done Torb proud yet again!
That looks clawsome as hell
Do you feel clawstrophobic at all in it?
Badass 👍

@mustachemanatee I’m a very proud clawdad
Love your posts very much. Happy Clawtober!
That's about 10 times bigger than I thought it would be hahaha it's crazy good!
@themixedtape thank you! And yea... the claw is stupid huge. I wanted to be able to get my hand inside part of it for stability/grip and so i could actually rotate it and not feel like captain hook all day.

@cyrellegaming I have a tattoo, but not a gaming related one. But I like yours! Altho your sleeve is kind of impressive as well 😍
Wow! Nice tattoo! 😏
Looks Beautiful Dear 💐

Unfortunately tattoos won’t be for me, terrified of needles 🤷‍♂️
@cyrellegaming definitely a Pokemon related one as it’s been such a big part of my life! Also a Harry Potter one for the same reason 😊
Looks so good!! Now I want one tho. 😔🥰
@moonpudding1 do it do it do it 🙌👏

I seen something like that before, sadly, it didn't seem to last long.
Is each card a game or something?
Wow this is so cool looking! I’ve never heard of this before
@smurfsyndrometv each card is 2/10 of a game (in most cases) 
This game has 5 cards and Each card has 2 barcodes that need scanned. When all 10 barcodes are scanned in the game will be playable
Wow this is so cool looking! I’ve never heard of this before
@allisonsav_nintendo_queen yeah the E-Reader was short lived and didn’t do very well mainly because it didn’t work very well!!
I had like all the cards!
@zapnightgaming that sounds like a lot of work haha
@smurfsyndrometv yeah then the card only successfully scans 30% of the time! 😑
I would love to try this

If there’s a certain mod there’s a secret pressure plate that when stepped on it activates a cammand bock that teleported you a few blocks back without you noticing
You think this is fucky, play a game called Antichamber.

Wir waren nur in der alten Heimat was aber auch immer wieder schön ist, Eltern verwöhnen einen ja auch immer sehr gern 🙌
@cathonakittycat Das ist doch schön muss auch mal sein 😊
Tatsächlich waren wir vor zwei Wochen in Warnemünde und hatten einen ähnlichen Ausblick 😁 und dieses Wochenende waren wir im Bayrischen Wald etwas entspannen 😍 Aber unser nächster großer Urlaub ist erst im nächsten Jahr 😊♥️ Wunderschöne Bilder hast du da gemacht 🌸😊
@chris.parvis klingt super! 😊🙌🏼 Toll wohin geht's dann? 😬 Vielen Dank 🙊 Hoffentlich sieht man dann auch schöne Urlaubsbilder von dir 😊🌊
@lisas_afterlife ich geb mir Mühe euch daran teilhaben zu lassen 😍 Dann geht es nach Kreta 😊🌟 Wird bestimmt mega schön ♥️
@chris.parvis Oh wie schön das wird es bestimmt 😍
What a beautiful place 🌊📸 :D
Honestly I ain’t even bothered , I mean I love destiny but I just feel they r messing things up for casual players and only focusing on the YouTubers and sweats and giving them what they want
@b.holmes02 i get that, but destiny has never been a casual player game, everyone is a tryhard, and youtubers like Gladd speak a ton of truth
@spam.boosif true
Not a problem the serwera are down anyway
Im buying this Friday @briannathancabral
Already haver date for 1.1?
@king_jingaling Go read about the upcoming patch. Legendary hunters are getting reworked. Keep up with the latest news brother

@schnupfnasee sagen Sie dem Alexander, er soll sich einen Account besorgen. Ich bin mir sicher, das Internet wird auf lange Sicht durchsetzen.
Looking forward to the next update! Can't wait to see the new legendaries and the reworks! Keep up the great work guys and gals! 😁✌️
@fooblee I usually keep up with the roadmap but must've missed this! Much needed! Cheers!
@joeyleecabral he looks so dope huh, I'll probably pick up the set also
Killed by XxGhostDemonxX - distance: 1000 meters - Caldwell conversion Uppercut - TROUGH THE WALL @sicuramente_non_manu
When it's coming to PS4?:(
I always do that Every time I shoot my gun.
@gianmarcocervelli nice
Never! Far more fun to run around like a headless chicken trying to panic reload while the other guy does the same and then a zombie gets involved and then some ducks fly away and then... *Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmmmmmmmm*
Can you help fix my game please it crashes everytime 3 mins into a match
3 seconds per bullet in uppercut is insane.
👌👌🔥🔥
Man! That is looking SO sick 🤩
Easiest to head head shot
I love you... That is all
Love the game. Keep up the great work
This skin with my bomb lance setup = ❤️
Me and my duo always compete for hunter kills and once the map is wiped we get both bounties and farm up by hanging out rather than leaving immediately. If anyone is trying to level up that’s the best way to do it. Just don’t waste your time with the water devils 😂
Why dont the legendarys go up in tier and come with equipment/perks? Considering their price.

I just recently played Wukong jg and his early is so fucking weak but late is pretty good
@pyke.ripper champ does no dmg at any point in the game lol
@desdain_of_heaven
@h_domonkos Literally it's not a late game champion.
@antoniofuhrer sorry I wanted to say mid game champ but he can be very usefull in the late game. Like with a Yasuo or something
Follow me for good memes
@h_domonkos Now that makes more sense
I'm one sad wu main... and will remain that way until he gets reworked... also why tf do you have a #gay tag ×D???
😂
literally me
@kwaku_asomaning u haven't seen my full ad wk yet....
@filip_aleksic888 well I m a WK main too, but I play full ad on all champ (Wk, j4, Leona, etc) all full ad
@filip_aleksic888 Hydra, Trinity, yoomu, duskblade 4 main item
@fernando_sudiarto I play wu as a bruiser, got bored of the full AD ×D
@filip_aleksic888 never get bored with full ad wk, coz I'm assassin, just learn how to E+basic+Q+Hydra(item click), before near enemy use W+Yoomu, I didn't even need bots just get relentless Hunter with electrocute
Wukong at all is the top
Thats total bs maybe Two years ago but Wukong is not more then a bonobo

A mí no me ha pasado nunca
A MI ME PASO PERO UN GHOST ME TIRO UNA BOLA DE FUEGO Y ME PRENDIO EL PORTAL
a mi me paso pero despues tiro otra lo prendi y raje
Shhshhahhd
😂
Nunca me ha pasado pero es muy mala suerte de que eso pase xD
@salmamustdie JAJAJAJAJA
Ahí teni que hacer la media wea de ir a buscar una fortaleza y encontrar uno... por eso siempre hay que llevar un mechero xd
@beronthomasg
@suricata.con.shalas Tambien hay otra manera, aunque es algo larga xd. Tienes que conseguir crema de magma, pólvora de los ghast y polvo de vara de blaze, juntas todo y tienes una carga de fuego para prender el portal.
@simplente_kled si es más larga pero es una buena opción
this is comedy
@fabiano_0703  recuerdas xdd
Le pegó un vrgazo cuando me tira la Wea de fuego el ghast y la dirijo al portal  me salvo de incintables siqcy
😢
Yo despues inocente y estupidamente empece a picar para arriba por que pensaba que el nether era el infierno, y el infierno estaria abajo de la tierra, y bueno termine por llegar al final y me suicide
Pero le pides a Tu hermano Que se meta al mundo solo para Que te lleve un mechero al nether
Ami me pasa :'v
A todos los que les pasa, en las nether forts se pueden encontrar mecheros, con el carbon que te sueltan los whiter skeletons y otros materiales mas se puede fabricar una carga explosiva para volver a encender el portal...
@fran_sad01 NUUUU QUE SALLL JAJAJAJAJAJA
@holasoyjavier_ok si no nos habrá pasado,y nosotros "/gamemode 1"
Ami aun no
@hctrssi y si no llevas hierro?
JajajajajJ yo llevo 1 de hierro por si pasa esl

@ren.dapian9
😢
Me pasó,por suerte puse un cofre para guarda para ese tipo de situaciones y me salvé,siempre usen preservativos
But haces q el ghast tire otra bola de fuego hacia el portal para q encienda y puedas ir a tu casita 🙃
@tiagomusan_
F
Yo literal estube 1 dia completo en la vida real en el nether fue como vivir otra vida hasta que me canse me mori de caida al lado del portal y ya pude recuperar mis cosas xd
El ghast lo rompe y lo repara a la vez
I have trades in different platforms, and it feels like I'm flying blind. It's great to have work with @georgerussie05 and his team trade setups which made me recover slot, I made $5500 with 500$ in just 7 days I truly recommend him @georgerussie05
@juan_x_muratore si? Mira vos che...
A mí no xdd
Es el fin
JAJAJAJAJA a mi me paso en mi mundo actual xD que bueno que tenía madera para una mesa y un cofre
@tipoconproblemas
@fatima_o.arce
Por suerte hay grava en el nether
But lo vuelves a prender con sus bolas de fuego :v
@j0ak0_20 DOOOOUUUU JAJAJAJ
pero traes 1 de iron
@jennifer_f12 i made you with your mom
@holasoyjavier_ok
Soy el único que lo activa con el ghast
Soy el único que lo activa con el ghast
@jeremiascontreras05 todo el mundo lo vuelve a activar con el ghast bruh
@jeremiascontreras05 es facil y de todas formas puedes craftear cargas igneas
Una vez lo prendi poniendo madera nose bRo
lo primero es cubrirlo con adoquines que son resistentes a las bolas del ghast XD
@agusgsi_ guatefak
Pones madera alado del fuego y se prende
Son todos re noobs yo lo prendo con las bolas que te tira el ghast
En ese momento tienen que tirar  todo sus cosas cerca del portal y tirarse a la lava
@munoserick33
@its.agustin16 Q Hp😂😂😂💔
Cargas igneas, el mismo ghast, madera cerca de fuego para que se vaya quemando, suicidarse cerca del portal y entrar desde el mundo normal, rolback, hay tantas soluciones :v

@evan.musonda Not Ansel, I used my player as a camera
@obi_sans_kenobi Same heart, same blood
@finfett also doesn't 99 was the only clone to have special voice (at least in Polish dub because i dont know if in original 99 was dubbed by different actor)
Such a strong unit
Hey thats me on the right!
These are my fav to play.... Even more than heroes
Hey dude awesome Pic! How do you make those photos in game in multi? Does Ansel allow you to "float" around the characters and take a shot??
@the_bearded_jango That’s Commando Droids for me!
@chadthedad7 maybe...
@martinscorch This wasn’t with Ansel. I’m playing as the camera.
@finfett so the way to get those I to spectate for the 3rd person view like that?
@martinscorch No, 1st person with HUD off
@finfett ok Tim
That's a pretty good one 🙌 I will be waiting for your next photo 😊👋

@nintendokristy I am too!! 😭🧡 A week later, but I finally am able to play this adorable game! 😍 I'm happy you enjoyed it so much!! 🥰🧡
Just about done with the game, and I really enjoyed every aspect of it! The chambers are a nice touch, though they could've done more with it, a la Super Mario Maker 😁
Omg I would have been going crazy with them not having it when it was first released 😂 I hope you enjoy it!!
Need to play catch up on this series - looks brilliant! 👍🏼
Great episode 👍👍Most of the other caves have Virginia's and cowmen, take advantage of the flora and fauna! shrooms for poison arrows, with the other collectable plants you can make health and stamina potions! start stocking up on bones for armour!
@charlotte_langton 👍 you should! it's great 😂
Sympa !! En effet ça pique ces revues :(((

What a blast from the past! My first video game console was an Atari 800XL. I was 6 when my family got one. Way back in 1984!!! Thanks for the memories! 😃😃😃

@tyskieandsailormoon oh das i ist eine 1 btw bin dumm
Good collection.
Mine personally was a 64. My parents were too poor to buy us gameboys so I mooched them off my friends sometimes to play Pokémon, but I bought my own 64 with babysitting money when I was 13 haha
Game boy color in purple
Nostalgia indeed! I remember most the gray Nintendo Game Boy 😅
@zeroomega22 I had one I got from my older cousin, my dad had enough of buying me batteries so got me a power adaptor but I left it plugged in for days and it caught 🔥 😅
@omeragic.edin I had a sega mega drive first but N64 was a massive favourite played Goldeneye all the time with my cousins
@keegon_the_lucario I pre ordered a Wii and they sold out 😮 I had to ring up to complain and managed to get one 😎
@waddlingweedle I completely skipped the gameboy colour, because I all I played was Pokémon silver and I didn't need a colour for that 😂
@zappertheampharos that's some determination ! I was lucky enough to get consoles for Christmas, but I had to save up for my first phone when I was 13 😅
@thatdantromp seems a popular choice, do you still have your original one ?
@itsjosh.jpg no
Gameboy advanced. I don’t have my original one anymore but I did buy another one last year.
@calictii I likes gameboy advanced having the original SP and micro I thought was interesting
Atari 2600! When I was 3 lol
@jamieslaysuk you remember that !?😮 I ended up buying one of those for £1.50 to leave at my grandparents
Nintendo Entertainment System 💕
@itsjosh.jpg 😂
@itsjosh.jpg First I've heard of that happening 😯
family computer! old console😆🎮
@chelseazendog Ooo the original 😮✨
@toppy___pi Famicom !
It was an N64, I still have it and play it, although the power supply needed replacing 😊
Wii
GameBoy Color - Purple 👀
Haha I was all like lemme grab his banner and I’ll head over th..... nvm your good hahaha 🔥🔥🔥
Fkn hammah!!
That's my least favourite gun as well 😂 you still popped off though 🔥🔥

@whatever_lola_wants13 What Lola Wants...... JP already knew about it!!!!
@bslaak This is the Nintendo Version.
This reminds me of the Zohan movie 😂
@bslaak I would hit the bird on purpose! Hated that damn thing and you didn’t even get more points if you hit it lol
So effing hard.
I hated this game!
Pretty sure this is where my anxiety started.
@postiedan California Games!
FOOT BAG! 😁😂😂
@dsmits84
I was just reminding my family about this video game last night, and looked up the foot bag video to show them... Your post is tripping me out.. Get out of my brain 😐😆
Wow, forgot about that part of the game, hackey sack! 👍
@bslaak remember this on our Lynx?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 QUICK! Somebody get the motor oil! 😄😉
I miss this game, haven't played it in 30 yrs
Looks awesome😎
*chuckles*
SCREW YOU KNUCKLES
Which Knuckles them tho?
Here I come, rougher than the rest of 'em. The best of them, tougher than leather. You call me knuckles, unlike sonic I dont chuckle (rewinds time to 1994), I'd rather flex my muscles

Demon's Souls deserves a remaster
@gam3r_19 عارف .. بس كنت أتمني الصراحه
@y_.187 يب زي دارك سولز ٢ مره فخم 😭🔥🔥،بس بالنسبة ليا كل سلاسل السولز حلوه ماعدا سيكيرو(بالنسبة ليا)
@soramoda  هيا كلها حلوه ماقلت شي بس  احس لها جو ثاني شخصيات اسلحه و بوسات وكل شي كانت بالنسبه لي لعبه كامله١  سولز
@m7md19880 حتى لو ريماستر على الاقل تصبيرة حتى تنزل لعبة اسطورية مثل النوع من الالعاب 👍
@m7md19880 كويس انهم مانسوها 😂
@dr.gamex الله يكفينا شرك 😂
@imustplay 🤭
@redbird.sa الريماست ترى يعدلون فيه على التحكم مو بس على الدقة 👍🏼
@imustplay معلومه جديده والله شكرا لك ♥️
@y_.187 اتفق خاصة العالم في الجزء الثاني خورافي ويخوف 💚😭 وماننسى لبس الهندي الي يجبلك ارواح زيادة😂
@soramoda هيا كلها سلسله السولز ادمااانن وربي اطلق سلسله من طريقه لعب ولا بوسات ولا اسلحه واحلى شي العالم المفتوح الي انت فيه انت وضميرك يعني تروح تلعب وتجيب اسلحه وتلفيل هذا الي خلاني ادمن على سلسله السولز😔🖤
@y_.187 يب زيك واخصة الي حببني فيها زيادة انه كان عمري يمكن ١٢ وختمت الجزء الثاني اول شي وكان مره صعب وقتها خاصة مرحلة الي يجون فيها سحره كثير ذيك قعدت فيها تقريباً ٤ ايام عشان بس اروح لضباب وافتح النار والموسيقى حقت المرحلة كانت تخوف مره😭💕💕💕
🔥😎
ياليييييت
@soramoda يب كمان موسيقى اابوسات كانت تدخلك جو ياخي دراك سولز الحب ياخي
يارب يطلع الخبر صحيح 😍😍
@y_.187 يب💚😭
يسون ريماستر و طريقة اللعب زي ريماستر دارك سولز ١ خايس ! لعبة و انتهت ما ابي اتذكر صوت كويلاق مره ثانية و هي تبكي يقلع شكلها
ي لطيف😍
فوق ذلك حصرية على بلاسيتشن ياواد اش القوى ذي 🔥😍
اتمنى ريميك لان القيمبلاي مرررررره صعب بالنسبه للجيل الحالي وغير كذا بطيئ جدا لكن في كلتا الحالتين اتمنى يجي
Dragonbone sword ⚔️💪🏻
ياليت لانها لعبة السولز الوحيده اللي مالعبتها 😭💓
المفروض يعملوا ليها ريميك علي محرك بلودبورن ودارك سولز ثرى
يمكن يوفرون لبعدين
ياخي لو يسوون بلود بورن ٢ 🤤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
توي لعبها ومختمها على ثري 👌🏻😴
@m7md19880 ما اتوقع يفضون ويسوون ريميك بخصوص انهم شغالين على لعبتهم الجديده آلدِن رينج 🙂
يالييتتت وربي افضل جزء ديمون سولز و دارك سولز 2 بعدها ماعجبني شي
@imustplay تصميمك روعه ما شاء الله عادي احسدك ؟

Chiamami col tuo nome è bellissimo davvero. Delicato ed emozionante 😍

I need to start building up my physical copy game list for psp! But I'm constantly finding games for sale with no cases 😢. They are out there right now throwing the cases away and there's nothing we can do 😭
@psprepairandmod I have seen that as well 😳 not good!
I have 32 i think physic games for psp, i love it and i'll keep collecting psp's games. sry for english
@tonibraka_ Your english is fine 😁 - glad to hear you are collecting for the PSP! Need more people on board 😁
I only have a few physical PSP titles, mostly series that I love on other platforms like Persona and Ys.  My Vita collection is pretty fleshed out though so maybe it's time to branch out.
Loving the pic. PSP ❤️

Kusakabe ce petit bout de chou ♡ mais c'est vers ce tome qu'on commence à voir du changement dans le comportement de Kyoya 😍 il est tellement attachant au fil des tomes après ❤️
@la.konekotaku je suis bien d’accord !
J'ai terminé la série et franchement je suis pas déçue !
@fandelavie_ vivement que j’avance un peu plus !
@romanegames je pense que ça te plaira !
@fandelavie_ je pense aussi!
Gentil garçon à 2000% 🙄
@eme_la_plume on est bien d’accord !
Je me souviens que l'anime m'avait bien plu, j'aimerai bien commencer cette série ! Sinon gentil garçon, c'est bien mieux ! :)
@miyo_bianca_chan franchement c’est pareil j’avais adoré l’animé!
It kinda snuck up on me because im just grinding boarderlands 3 for the past week . i just hope shadowkeep hits the spots in all the right places
@iamlamajnoham that’s a whole bunch of ppl bro thats why they were all happy that Bungie pushed shadowkeep by two weeks 😂
@xepherege i feel i might be a little underwhelmed for it tho cause the loot drops in boarderlands its amazing . and moving from one boss dropping like 15 guns and mods to getting about 2 guns and something else
@iamlamajnoham nahh i feel you bro, the amount guns was the real deal for borderlands 3 when it was announced. For me im just excited to try out shadowkeeps content made by bungie alone and power leveling again
🔥🔥🔥 awesome bro!!
Yooo bro💀😍
Le coup de vieux! 😂 je trouve ça cool que tu conserves ça, la bonne époque 😁
J'en ai encore mais j'en ai hélas perdu beaucoup aussi suite à des soucis d'humidité dans ma cave etc.
@x.ghostshadoow Arf ouais, faut faire attention où les conserver, surtout que ça s'abîme vite 😐
@playurdreams Oh oui, le bon vieux temps de revoir tout ça 😊
@gamergirl.fr Oui je sais, malheureusement par manque de place et également un peu par oubli, je m'en suis rendu compte ici en préparant mon déménagement 😕
@x.ghostshadoow C'est sur qu'on y pense pas forcément
@gamergirl.fr Heureusement il m'en reste encore pas mal !
@x.ghostshadoow Ah ouf, tout n'a pas été perdu 😜

Yay
Great news 😃👍👍

Leggo questo commento mentre cerco partita killer... Segni del destino
@casimiroo_grumaioli ma cosa? Io da killer aspetto MINIMO 6-7 minuti
@dead.by.daylight_italia guarda la live di zeb... pochi minuti. Forse pk giochi su xbox... conta che è un gioco mezzo morto su pc... figuriamoci su console.
@casimiroo_grumaioli già, sicuramente zeb ci mette di meno perché gioca da pc
@casimiroo_grumaioli dai morto non credo, fa i sui 15.000 players giornalieri
Ci ha messo meno tempo Ad arrivare l'annuncio della 4 stagione di Stranger things 😐

Awww man and I got a -atk one :(
Why would you give a mage that much hp
@bird_with_juul im sorry :(( at least she'll be good for decreasing lift lost
@shehfgjeusbzkasab idek but it definitely couldve gone into any of her other stats
@emblem.birb_ Is ok. Better than not getting her at all, well at least for me.
I don't care about her stats because she was a free summon😂
@shehfgjeusbzkasab she’s specifically an ar unit which relies on hp checks
@robingrandmaster no one cares lol jk
What's the bst
@inklinginksssbu you looking to scrap😤
@robingrandmaster scrap brain zone? :0
I find it ironic that every playable boss unit so far has lived up to their story incarnations...
...except for Thrasír.
Now I just feel bad.

Just imagine a naked Zerg rolling the wheel into a war zone. Having nakeds with bows as the firing line and a naked rolling the piano to play twinkle twinkle little star

I love that game, do you got the case?
@usuario_de_insgr I don’t have the case 😔. I wish I did! I used to throw my cases away (I don’t know why...), so I don’t have cases for 90% of the games I had growing up.
@reyalsgaming but still works Soulsilver?
That copy is likely fake because of the plastic on the cartridge :(
@itz.nemera I’ve played it for about 140 hours. Lol.
@itz.nemera and I bought it from a retail store. Lol.
@reyalsgaming I have a wild world copy, but the soul silver I bought was fake and looked exactly like yours!
@reyalsgaming good 4 u, Just checking 2 b sure
@itz.nemera If this is a fake copy, they did a damn good job making it play exactly like the real copy. Lol. It’s all good. Thanks for the heads up. 😁
😍😍😍❤️❤️👑

Best horse in the game imo I named mine Belethor after the merchant in Skyrim
@wizards_and_outlaws that's a fantastic name! Mine is Eredin after the Wild Hunt king
@rdr2_kat ooh nice!! That’s a really cool name
Looks REAL 😲
Is it good? I really like it's looks but I want a fast horse as well 😅.
@lunargames_ it's a great horse! I love him
Named mine brimstone lol
@garrett_beckner yep we have had several requests to bring them back 🔥
@james_peng_cheng haha true
@quantum004 Lore and Ruby as well, I hear ya
@noah_vasquez_26 very nice, congrats! 😎
@_hrv_official they are basically assisted flip knives with a stiletto look, you got it
@psychedelic._.butterfly blinged out 🔥
@jjslayer1130 glad to hear that! 👍
@tymf1st we can only do what customs allows, so we get restricted a bit leaving the US
@nilooperez agreed, very!
@majcater what @noah_vasquez_26 said 👍
@templetonnn.j each have their own look, Black Pearl looks evil 😎 🔥
@kevin_ks_04 sorry man we would if we could!
@elementalknives Oh yeah the ruby. When you guys first released the stilettos I bought both. I think I might make an exception for the hb tho
How much do they cost?
@elementalknives No, it's like wow that's pretty good
@elementalknives heck yeah
There illegal in australia
@kevin_ks_04 lmao knifes are banned there right
@glewis712 Hahahah so are butterfly knives, but that didn’t stop them.
I just want Karambits to be legal in my country so I can buy one 😞
Muy bonita 🔥
I don’t know the black pearl is sick as fuuuuu
Are these automatic or folders
I’ve only got the tiger tooth but it’s real sexy 😍
CAN YOU BRING THESE TO CANADA!?!?!!?!?!!
Looks amazing! But, a stiletto opens differently than this knife. This knife is a switch blade. Unless I’m wrong and the knife opens by shooting out from the front. Because thats how a stiletto opens. Again, looks amazing
I was thinking of getting the fade
Day 200000 of asking for an ek boomerang
A new 24k gut knife would look good too
I want one but the thing is the handles throw me off. You have a fade but the handle doesn't really match. I want the lore tho. I think the night and the lore are the only two with diff handles
I need it but UK so I need a license for a butter knife so rip
@_hrv_official the blade you buy off of EK is an assisted opening blade so it is actually not an OTF (the proper name for a switch blade. And different models of true stiletto knives open in different ways
@majcater it’s an assisted opening so it folds and the buttons are purely for looks
My hype beast looks so good
@noah_vasquez_26 I thought the nead on the side was a button, sorry about that. Yes its a spring assisted flip knife. But ai still stand by my claim that it’s not a stiletto
Like fuck plz
Plz release them in eu
@tuseguidorbro not feeling it eh? What's your choice?
@cursed_to1lets Lore, right?😂
@wiryparty_kaicanada it's pretty epic, good choice 👍
Ufff rainbow
😮😮😮this might be in my top 5
Omg what is this??
@killjoy_kupcake it's called ko-fi you can buy people coffees lol it's just a way of showing some love
If I had the muneh then I would 😂

OMG that's one of Kamitani's works, I'm in love!!!! 💖 Super lucky Adrian, congrats 🎉🎉
I always wanted a Sega Saturn...it’s like, the only I haven’t owned 😮
Really wish this game had an English patch 🤘
@doctorhalprinstein There are lot of cool exclusives like Nights and Panzer Dragoon, but TBH the hardware itself isn’t great compared to PS1.
Omg the link is sooooo adorable
@thepinknarwhal He’s so shiny too!
Like amazing!!!
@leo_goicochea
@gamarragutierrezzz estas equivocado amigo
@_rama_.ok Qué juego celebra antes su aniversario? 🙄
Uuuuh que mal
Xd
Bro hasta yo sé que son diferentes y soy mujer
Aguante free fire
@franredgal20 yo
😂
Tu novio es un pobre diablo
Es mejor el Free fire que el fortnite
Que horrible juego free es mas bueno :v
@garciaesquitangeladrian9 tiene razón bro
Freefire es mejor
@_rama_.ok he se nota que no sabe nada salio el pubg,el fortnite el 26 de septiembre del 2017 y el asco del free fire el 4 de diciembre del 2017 y @gamarraguitierrezzz tiene razon :v😂
La pregunta es porq sale vegetta777
Oye eso ea un insulto para mi y eso que juego los dos
@_valeria.luna_ x2
Es la misma basura pero de diferente basurero
Solo que el del fortnite usa la katana y sube videos con canciones construyendo para arriba como pendejo y el del free se pone un nombre tRyHaRd y es prieto
@santiagomg4 ay si 😍
@zaskeeeee Narutoooooooo😂
Yo juego freee
@farwar_13 ajajjajajajja
Lo mismo pero más barato .jpg jajaja 😂😂🙄
No se toman 1 minuto para ver la diferencia
@franredgal20 los pobres
@franredgal20 yo lo juego y no soy pobre al igual que juego al fortnite y no me gusta.
@franredgal20 pero eso no es pubg? Me rayo😂
No me faltes al respeto yo si distingo el maincraf del pubg
😂
@angel_09_02_04 no😂, yo tengo el pubg, he jugado al Free Fire por probarlo y lo borre al momento de lo basura que es
@franredgal20 ajajjajaja
??
@_rama_.ok Es que tu juegas juegos que son copias 😉🤷🏻‍♂️
Y free fire es mejor
@marshmello_marshmello_yt autolike JAJAJAJAJAJ fortnite es mejor que esa mierda
@gamarragutierrezzz el primer juego que salió de esto fue el pubg y luego fue el free fire y luego de esto salió el fortnite. Así que infórmate antes de opinar
@_rama_.ok Free Fire salió después que Fortnite sólo que ellos sacaron para móvil osea para gente que gasta sencillo en un juego 😉
No le llega ni a la punta del dedo gordo del pie esa cosa jajaja
Para mi no es tu novio 😂😂
Le digo a esto a fri fair GAYY PLUMA GAYYY
😂 Khe asco de feefire
Me gusta mas el fre fire que el fortnute😂
No el free es basura 😂
Jajaaja
@marshmello_marshmello_yt Concuerdo con su opinion🧐
Mujeres be like:
Nop ambos jugamos al fortnite juntos aún que aún no estamos juntos
Kd os Br kkkkkk
@sebastiancanizzo 11 años, cállate sí?
Quien juega la mierda de Free Fire?
@marshmello_marshmello_yt 😓
@_.valeb._ pucha, que sad💔
@zaskeeeee me callo si quiero la  concha de tu madre
Los no
Juego los dos y son buenos juego
Yo juego los dos 😂
Yo juego los dos:(

I don’t see what it got to do with BatIM since they aren’t Ink Aliens but this looks great :0 maybe you should make it its own thing ^^
@vincynical Well, we’ve been using all the characters from the game, so that’s why it’s a Bendy AU. We’ve considered making it its own thing one day, but we’ll see.
Hmm this looks really interesting. 👍🏻
The subway scene looks like the start of a movie ;) 👏
phenomonal art but all i can think about is how henry looks like my dad and im shaking

Grew up playing with 2nd top row, but there’s a reason TMNT 1990 is on top
Top row!
3
1st row.
What's the bottom row?
I can’t decide between the top two. Do I choose the movie or the figures that I had as a child and still sit on my sheet to this day ? 🙈
@shanekirshy You pre-ordered Bebop and Rocksteady? You can pre-order a foot soldier two pack as well! 😎
2
1&3
All of them. Seriously.

@latinakoki23
Last row
1st and 2nd top. Legend
Why did they make Leo look sad for the classic figure? I always wondered that haha
2
2nd will always be my favorite.
1st row lookin most reslistic like in the 90s movies. 2nd row are the classic figures from that era. 3rd row lookin like the ones from the series. Last row are new for me...
1990 baby. 🐢🐢🐢🐢
2nd row from the top. The OG’s. Because it was the first set I ever got at 5 yrs old in 1988/89’
2nd row
2nd row from the top

“If she says anything but the top row, SHE’S TOO YOUNG FOR YOU BRO”
@djbigwhitey @l3ng_tch3
2 til death 🔥🔥 😎💗
All except 4
Last row

@nicolas.jordan.87 second one?
2
If I had to pick... Second row. But  any turtles in 80s and 90s. The rest I'd have to pass on. 🐢❤️🍕🔥
1st row always and forever the 1st row. 😍
Second row classics
2
Row 4 has that Macho Man Randy Savage neck
@shanekirshy I'm saving up for the Neca Shredder. Shame you can only get him with the Leo...Got no use for him 😅
Top
Two Version,  my preferred
1 $ 4 🤘
Top. But number 2 holds a special place in my heart
1 and 2!
Original lineup 👍
2nd row... Then the first
Leo
First all the way
I would say top, but Mikey’s drugged up eyes always creep me out
Always second row
All of them 😉👍
#2
1 y 4
1+2
3
I've always loved the cutesy ones in the third row, remind me of my Merry Christmas dudes stocking I used to have. Obviously the top ones from the movie are the best
SHFiguarts are amazing figures! Shame they never went ahead with their Shredder figure 😔
2
Gotta be row 2
Row 1
1
@tmntmarvelfanboii I was bummed about that too, but the Neca one (from the two-packs) looks great and matches with these nicely!
Top and bottom .. top is too movie like to not like the other best classic looking in my opinion
No its a stupid ass childs game
No fortnite gay
@domhpriv17 👐
@biggiek_ Because have very children
Fortnite is gay
No
No, not really. But thanks for asking.
How dare they put Naruto’s run in the game...

I have a feeling this gonna flop worse than the first one
👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 I don’t even understand how the first game sold enough to make a 2nd game possible. Give me a My Hero game made by arc sys that lays like MvC. The free mobile game coming out is gonna be better than this garbage lol
It better be better than THE FIRST ONE!! 😤😤😑😑
@sircspam no it should be than the first one😭 they can't make the same mistake of the first one😭😭 because then they DUMB ASF

@positivelyspeaking_ 😂 aww y’all are so great! 2 broke besties! That’s the best way to explain parenthood in general! And you never know you might get a little girl surprise! And of course granddaughters will be fun one day 💕😘

@iz_madonna ☺️ thanks 🙏🏾
Phew💙 he looks just like bruva
@dayheadhuncho_ 😆 yesss! Thanks

Yesss same. My son is my youngest and lord knows I’m out of commission
@nayeezus Charlie said, “Heeey Auntie” 😂
@miiilkmariee_ 😂 that’s how those boys do us girl moms! It’s a whole new world 🙌🏾🌎
@thatkindaluv  omg yes sissss.  My daughters are daddy’s girls so the love of being spoiled is definite.

@the_wakaholic ☺️ I agree! He is dads little twin 💙💙
@andy_dem ☺️❤️😘
Love it .... 😍😍😍
As a mom of two boys, I sometimes still desire having a little girl but I'm so happy they you have the experience of both. Definitely a bond between a son and mother is unlike any other. Now I understand when my mom used to say that about my lil brother since I'm a daddy's girl. My boys definitely keep me busy but it's amazing and my hubby is of course over the moon with his two broke besties😂😂😂😂
What movie is this from??
@cocio166 sharkboy n lavagirl
@cocio166 interstellar movie
@cocio166 Star Wars
I'd rather wait there for xbox and halo Infinite and for the breath of the wild sequel
rip he died
Dude I LOVE this game!! Had no idea you could get it physical!!
@chronikspartan hell yeah! This is the only one aside from the switch collectors edition, I'm not even 100% sure if that was even really a thing
@thenerdlair88 didn't know it was out of the Switch! Man I need to brush up my knowledge!
Will be watching the episode at lunch 😉
@tokengeekguy Goddammit!!!
@tribblewilliam 😳😳👍🏻

@khaledz1l جامده
@xlv87 😂
nice post 😅
nice post 😅
Cool💥🔥
Yaaaaas!
I really enjoyed that Ghostbusters game when it dropped during last console generation. I think $30 is a steep price for a "remaster" of it but I'd definitely recommend it if it drops < $20 around the holiday digital sales.
@takingshape Good to know. I missed it the first time around and was curious if it was any good.
@consolecalendar I'm a huge fan of the movies & cartoon so I'm biased but the fact they got all four of the original guys in the voiceover booth as well as Annie Potts back as Janine was an impressive feat.
New catalysts
new gear/guns
The dungeon! But everything looks cool
Hand cannon bufff
Armor 2.0 and some Awesome new gun's
Armor 2.0

Getting the nostalgia of grinding back when the last dlc that changed destiny forever (taken king) came out .
Everything
@antjospre_ the moon is indeed haunted. The hive has taken over the Scarlet Keep. The vanguard will issue an assault onto the moon, accompanied by other guardians and vanguardians. Goodluck!
@_moons_haunted_ but when will it be exploitable. I wanna clap some moon hive cheeks
@antjospre_ give it a week. Knowing our community, they'll figure out something.
@_moons_haunted_ thanks

Khovostov

Just something new to play like activities and the power grind.
@volyy.hoo lowkey gets mad boring after spending 3 months at max level.

@prompto.shortcake “I forgot, but there is that cup o' noodles stand! So we can eat there.”
@prxnce.noctis “Sounds like a good deal to me buddy! I could eat right now anyways.”
@prompto.shortcake “Lets go then, whoever gets there first has to pay. Deal?”
@prxnce.noctis “Okay ready...set..” he looks over at Noctis.
@prompto.shortcake  Noctis looked back over at him, “Go!” He began running towards the right side stairs, making his way up it. //I wanna apologize if my rping isn't very good rn, I'm tired
@prxnce.noctis Prompto whined. “H-Hey!” He laughed and followed catching up to the prince. // it’s okay same here I’m running on very little sleep
@prompto.shortcake Noctis laughed too, and soon after they ran up the stairs, they arrived at the stand. Although it wasn't a far run, Noct was out of breath and leaned down with his hands on his knees to catch his breath. It seemed like Prompto had won by a second. //it's only 3:30pm for me and I slept for awhile, but I'm still tired 😂
@prxnce.noctis Prompto kept laughing running as fast as he could after Noctis. He was a little past him now once they reached the stand. He stopped to catch his breath too. “Whew! So I won huh?” He grinned at Noctis. //I’m always tired such a mood 😂
@prompto.shortcake //i just realized I said 'whoever gets there first, has to pay' I'm such an idiot. I meant 'whoever gets there last'
@prompto.shortcake //I'm tired 24/7 too 😂
@prxnce.noctis //it’s okay 😂
@prompto.shortcake “Yeah, you won! Congrats. I'm paying.” He stood up, he grabbed his wallet out of his backpocket and paid the guy at the stand. He put his wallet back as they waited for the guy to give them a couple cups o' noodles.
@prxnce.noctis “Dude thanks, it was close though.” He smiled straightening his posture. “This place smells good , can’t wait to have some noodles.” He stood there waiting with him.
@prompto.shortcake “Gladio would be jealous,” he chuckled. “I think Ignis could make this at camp, though. He can make anything.”
@prxnce.noctis “Totally! Big guy would be so jelly right now. I do too I think Iggy can make about anything.” He nodded in agreement.
@prompto.shortcake “It's like he has magic powers, he can seemingly make food out of nowhere. Maybe he's a wizard!”
@prxnce.noctis “I think he a secret one or something.” He chuckled folded his arms.”He’s got some mad skills.”
@prompto.shortcake “I'm almost jealous, but I think it's better that he's the one that cooks. I'll stick to fishing.”
@prxnce.noctis “I’m jealous too. I’m lucky to make toast.” He chuckled. “Yeah that’s probably for the best Noct.”
@prompto.shortcake  The guy finally came back and handed them the noodles with a spoon, he warned that it was hot and it was best to wait to eat it. Noct nodded, “Maybe I should get some lessons from Ignis and I can teach him some fishing.”
“Yeah we’ll goof off some while we wait for her.”

Loooved Grandia! 👍
Nice pickups! Silent Hill just in time for Halloween!
Such great games!
@kanpai.customs it's one of my favorite RPG franchises in PlayStation history.
@pabgames it's actually not pickups. They're games that were released on this day years ago. That being said I have owned these games at various times in my life.
@hayz_collection I'm going to make a prediction that the coming days and months are going to be filled with a lot of great games.

Pure facts
Nope.
Which game is this ?
@thehimanshu_sharma battlefield 5, red dead redemption 2, Apex legends.
If I payed extra, could I get a DMG shell that's trimmed to work with @kiteretro's Circuit Sword Lite?
I love this never played F-Zero unless smash Bros
Looks good, probably would have gone with a pink or black accent on the bar rather than purple though.
Great job

@justeuneparenthese Ce qu’on va faire c’est que tu ne vas pas acheter le jeu. Ça t’évitera d’aller le revendre une fois que tu auras pris ta douille 😘

Reduce Reuse
I used to feel so sad for this Jigglypuff when I was a kid.
Recycle!
Recycle👌
Recycle a great card too
This is what professor Willow does when you transfer Jigglypuff in Pokemon Go
Had this card, always disliked the art for some reason... I think it’s the ears and feet
@cartoon_croissant I do now
Underrated
Sad shiny jiggly
Reduce reuse recycle 😍
Poor
Recycle! ♻️
OMFG THIS CARD IS MY CHILDHOOD
Recycle! This has always been one of the most intriguing and interesting card artworks for me. Keiji Kinebuchi is the illustrator, he unfortunately left tpci but oh well...
3132 8658 6002
Absolutely. Look at that expression. Is this what happens in the Poke-centers?!
1927 4526 8222
I remember this card..recycle I think!
@ali_six_ wait what, never realised it is a shiny. Loooooool
Poor jigglypuff

@_jessieex jaaaa mooi heh
@sebastiano_pala you can't take conclusions
@cesarfuckingramos not talking about ignite, im talking in general
It heals you that much even with greavous wounds?
@guillezafra Heal will be reduce because of GW (Heal’s amount isn’t write on this post), but it will negate that much yes :)
devprogamer > mobalytics 🤭
@sebastiano_pala cleanse>barrier
@haioken_magno and still u will take only 16 dmg from the ignite😂
@haioken_magno what is wrong dude?
@b_ahmadreza to not get deleted 😂
@ily_gnar u cant do the big bait with cleande
@ily_gnar cleanse**
@sebastiano_pala yes I can :)
@ily_gnar well then ill hit you with the "you cant take cleanse every game"
@sebastiano_pala who says?😏
@sebastiano_pala Support Nasus with Cleanse OP
@ily_gnar xerath adc dark harvest barrier OP
@sebastiano_pala not as op as nasus supp with cleanse
@ily_gnar what about xerath adc  dark harvest barrier and nasus supp with cleanse botlane
@sebastiano_pala perfection 👌
@ily_gnar 😍😍😍
Then why the hell ppl take barrier against ignite...
@b_ahmadreza this Is wrong
Ignite also reduce the amount of healing
@b_ahmadreza cuz the ignite Is not all in a game
Barrier>heal
Can you do one with potions?
Nice shot 🔥
Absolutely amazing 😍💙😍

@i_like_clout i appreciate it! I won’t be able to get on until tonight; I’m on EST.
@mikesnow88 ok
Bygones is better.....no mattee what its legendary meaning you can run other exotics ... better perks
@mikesnow88 What time est though?
@i_like_clout most likely 10-11pm. If I can get on earlier I’ll send you a message on PS. Any idea how long it takes to obtain?
@mikesnow88 It can take around 10 min if we do it wrong because we haven’t done the mission in a long time
@i_like_clout wait, isn’t D2 offline all day/night until Shadowkeep Launch?
@mikesnow88 No but I’ll look it up to tell you the time
@mikesnow88 oh no it is off all day rip but I’ll help on shadowkeep launch tomorrow after school
@other__________________ reset
@miyagi_l_azza_marls this is the truth. Cant handle it then yall can dip fam
@callum_newbs03 im a esports player. Outbreak dps pve i get that but pvp bygones all day
hand cannons next
My boy Outbreak, and I just got it too 👀
Why wasn't go figure an option. I've been running a God roll go figure since the start of shadowkeep and it's still holding strong
Outbreak, loaded question, probably swarm of delirium. Gonna be my go to for PvE in shadowkeep
@xbox_pizzle maybe do scout rifles or hand cannons
@blarose06 had to choose 8 as the comp would have gone on for too long so something had it give
@nopleaseimonlysix or*
@xbox_pizzle I see. Its just that go figure has been my baby and my main weapon. I really like it is all.
I didn’t vote for Outbreak because I still don’t have it 😭 Just achieved Redrix’s Broadsword though 🤗
No surprise there
Not a big surprise
@xbox_pizzle went exactly how i said👀
@mikesnow88 What you play on I’ll help
@i_like_clout PS4

Really?
@n4z1m_raah i posted it on tiktok awhile ago
@flaming.glory yes 🙌🏽
@__mdibrahem__ hippie Sabotage devils eyes
Damn this be funny af 😂
Sithpost Saturday is your best friend, right?
Got into a strike/extraction game yesterday.. It was 2 vs 3 😂
Aaaaaaaayyyyyyyy 5/7 is that meme I made I posted on reddit 😂 thx for posting
But seriously it's lien EA completely forgot about Starfighter assault....
No supremacy does not need OT and ST
What mode has the sarlaac pit?
Sorry but my stinger pistol does absolutely nothing
Its sarlacc
So I'm not the only one where the clone commando repulse blast doesn't work?
Always killing with the memes 😭
@nthayslett Felucia
It should be noted that starfighter assault was the most redeeming quality at launch
perfect😂😂😂rey ❤️
Clone commandos are too OP
Starfighter assault is too true damn 😔
RIP Starfighter assault
Poor Starfighter assault
@darth_hatred it depends on how close you are
@ectree19
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hold up which map is the Sarlacc pit on
@drewbenoit Felucia
These meme 👏
Hot/10
I've only played like Street Fighter 2 who is this lol
@matthew_the_mecha_dude She is an amazing sfv character. Check her out! https://youtu.be/nbDSvRMc9rQ
@matthew_the_mecha_dude side note: she is also Zangeif’s student
@sharkteath Ohhhhh okay, I do recall seeing her design
Very small chance of getting anything better than a rare/blue because I did it with 1,000 and got 1 epic/purple
@jasooon2332 😂 Yeah I had a feeling. Still, it’d be cool to see a crap ton of guns on the ground. I’ll just sell em for SDU’s.
Yeah it is
I did it in sanctuary
@jasooon2332 I wanna do it in Ellie’s area.
Have you gotten the handsome jackhammer yet because it is the funniest gun. It's good stats but the running commentary by handsome Jack is hilarious
@ven_omous final sdu upgrades cost 2.15 million
Yeah probably the best area for it
@jasooon2332 Lol I haven’t. Sounds cool.
No one gives af
@mattgaud2425 ok mat
Ooooof thats dirty
Can someone explain this in siege terms
LoL is trash
@djmanchan this game call league of legends the genre is moba, 5v5 player with minions ai, the objective is you need to destroy the enemy tower, but if you want to play league of legends you need to move to asia like china korea taiwan or vietnam, bcuz in america league of legends are not popular
@rrq672 I didn’t ask what this game is, I ask if someone can explain what happened in siege terms
Actually poops his pants 💩
@slutty_unicorn Matt edgy as f
I don't even come close to understanding this game 🔩

Piss off this isn’t borderlands COD is a$$
Historically accurate
@littledeepdishes what are you talking about
Is bf1 server full of ppl or dead
Mean! I love these kinds of game play
Como se llama ese juego por favor me dicen
I love battlefield 1
Like me the other day on the same field. 🤘🤘
Hell yeah man 👊🏼
@sg_pr77 Call Of Duty World At War
@sg_pr77 is Battlefield 1
@danmuglas the dice team say thet bf1 even after this long is a very active and popular game
@danmuglas it's dead lmao
Holy shiit , is this EZRA !!
They come out with this unreal game and then absolute garbage in BF5
I'll stay off of apex til you're back ☹️

@christy_k06 💖💖💖💖💖

Ha android
Gangster Mario got in but not Luigi
What’s the song to the second slide
He’s in the game just not playable
@no_barn no they're gonna use them for marketing and monetization
@kobey.johnson_ yeah in the files
Why would they make luigi not playable....why
@piikachuu._ no I seen him in game
@punishedjoestar to add him in later and make people spend money on their game
@uncomfortableinsunglasses they are going to add them in later and make people spend money on their game
Song?
Then again Pauline has been around longer😂😂😂
Y'alls do know that like Pauline was the "Peach" of the first game Mario was in. So like she's basically a tribute to the original
@i_love_hi_c that’s very WACK but alright
He probably will be put in when the tour goes to Italy. Pauline was put into the game because she is the mayor of new donk city basically the New York of super Mario odyssey you uncultured swines. A lot of people that play Mario kart tour are normal asf but never owned any of the actual games lmao.
Already seen it. The whole thing was cringe 🤣😭
Luigi is too good for this shitty fucking game. He's got better things to do, like clean out ghosts from hotels and shit
he was in the beta
@ben.perk facts
Someone definitely got fired for forgetting Luigi
Dude what pisses me off most about is both he and Rosalina were playable in the beta, so they didn't just forget them, they straight up yote em out of the game
@uncomfortableinsunglasses There probably was bugs and glitches with Luigi and Rosa. So too meet their deadline, they removed them. I’m sure In a soon update they’ll be back.
I feel like they're gonna have them when the New York tour is over cause they put them in the promos and everything I would hope they didnt forget about them
Theyre not in the game yet because Mario Kart Tour is a gatcha game so theyre gonna put them in later on as pulls for rubies or whatever they are
Characters like Luigi and Waluigi will he added later for rubies they’re pulling a Rainbow Six basically. Waluigi was in the trailer so
Gangster Mario got in but not Luigi
See that's why it's trash
Facts
They might be saving him and other characters for future tours.
theres no way they doing pauline like that

Definitely my favorite of the newly released mini consoles. I wonder if Nintendo is planning a N64 mini?
You getting the turbo graphix mini?
@ryandelpo I'll wait and see if its worth it. I didnt think the PS1 was
Imo this is the best one they nailed it.  Even put a few games some people dont know they like yet like alisia dragoon n landstalker.  The NES was tainted with low sales and scalpers but was a good list.
i LOVE the official nintendo dealer sign!!! maan, where do get something like that..
@chessshirecat its imported from Belguim and ran with a converter. Exclusive vintage Belguim sign that pops up from time to time.
thanks for the info @jonebone7
Pazienza? Grazie a te per esserti prestato ai miei ordini 😂

@loris.federici thank you! 🙂
@dramaticentrance4
Mankey is between with raikou and bulbasaur, abra is in the sea's rock and hirmonchan is in the house (im spanish, my level of english isnt magnífic)
Where is vaporeon
Shiny misdreavus
Oh that’s hot. Almost as hot as my hand press videos.
Mankey is to the left with Tyranitaur and Ponyta. Hitmonchan is on the house deck with Raticate and Koffing. And Abra is sitting with Eevee on the boulder by the ocean. Phanpy looks like he is drowning and I thought Persians hated water. Also isn't Machamp too heavy to be swimming in the ocean.
@ethanwilliford1621 idk? I only see Eevee and Flareon.
@scharawill oof he deserves to be in the  water
@ethanwilliford1621 truth.
Bonus challenge!  Can you find, Swinub,  Phanpy and Furret?
Spinarak and ariados are just chillin and walkin on water?
Well that was easy
There’s a shiny riachu
Nice haha

@avakin.summersoul I forgot 😅 I'm sorry!
@elliesbrokenwatch Nvm I found it lol
does anyone know how many gb this is? is it gonna be over 100gb and on 2 disks? im considering buying a ps4 just for this ajfksjcka
THEY ARE ADORABLE HOLY SHIT
@despina__b no idea. Probably a pretty massive game. It's two discs like rdr2
I hope this isn't foreshadowing
Some rest
Happy monday
Foreshadowing something maybe? Or just a joke
This SCREAMS foreshadowing
ugh love your account so much your edits are satisfying 💕💖💓💅🏻
I honestly hope this isn't an example of Naughty Dog's foreshadowing
@elliesbrokenwatch oh i see. how does this work tho do i have to play the first disc first and then i have to play the second one? im kinda useless when it comes to this stuff ugh
Can't wait til this shit comes out 😔finna be so good
@despina__b no. One is a data disc and then the other is the disc you use to play the game whenever you play it
@elliesbrokenwatch ohh so i "download" it with the first disc and i basically only use the 2nd one after that?
I want to know the punchline :(
😂 he was catching them hands #hegonnacryinthecar
WHAT GAME IS THIS?
@brownbunnygaming River City Girls. If you like beat 'em ups, I definitely recommend it.
I need this so bad...😭
I CAN NOT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON THIS GAME!!! I am so looking forward on playing this game I don’t know what it is about it but had my eyes on it for a very long time 😍😍😍
@eringobrad you will enjoy it!
@level_up_g_ they're basically trying to find and get their kidnapped boyfriends back. A lot of butt gets whooped in the process
@thedevoutjoystick #fistsoffury
@blackgamergirl What made it funnier is he looked like he was throwing a fit, you stepped back and let him have it again after he was done 😂😂😂
@blackgamergirl 😂 so I can see looking forward on play this ☺️
Totally want to play this! What do you think so far?! After I'm done with Cuphead, this will be next 🤩
@audreydifaye the game is great. Very addictive!
I have it downloaded, Can't wait to l=play.
This looks dope af, are you streaming this!?
@xohoneyjack I'm not but I can if people want to watch 😊
@techgeeknelson I definitely reccomend it. Very fun title and easy to learn
This is a game where I actually like the SNES version more!
@ultragoldenant snes 4 life!!!
@grablifebythecontroller Shove it! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@ultragoldenant lol never!
I never liked it! Then again i only really appreciate fighting games for the sprite art and animations and not really for gameplay at all. Btw i see samus back there! Maybe peaches can stitch you her spaceship like she made mario😄
@eringobrad this is probably the fighting game i suck the most at times be honest. I’m even better at the nes version
@grablifebythecontroller you dont have the nes version do you?? Thats very spensive
@eringobrad i don’t have the cart but i have it on my multicart
It’s really bad in my opinion. Like horrible.
@1985nintendo so far i can’t get far but i do like the way the characters look
I have the NES version. The SNES version is better.

2  like RMS Mauretania

The "roar of steel" white and grey camo paint scheme on the north Carolina and Iowa is probably my favorite. It make both of those ships look intimidating.
3 for sure

@drunkenscotsman2002 that’s not the Olympic...

@drunkenscotsman2002 it’s alright, the ship in the photo is the RMS Mauritania, she looks quite identical to the Titanic/Olympic
Man, you wouldn't think Indiana Jones would be so hard to make into a decent video game, but there's way more bad Indy games than there are good ones
@princeofbrains well, let's take a look at the good ones: Fate of Atlantis, Emperors Tomb, Lego Indiana Jones the Original Adventure, Lego Indiana Jones 2 the Adventure Continues, Last Crusade point and click, 3 Melons Lego Indiana Jones series. There are quite a lot of stellar Indy games.
Johnna and I have been watching the tv series. I don’t know why I haven’t watched it before. I like it a lot.
@the_agill don't forget arcade Temple of Doom and Greatest Adventures for SNES.
@therealdire51 I never liked the arcade Temple but maybe I'm just bitter 😂
@princeofbrains *tsk tsk tsk*
@swiftcloud it was a really good series. It also ended up being a testing ground for some of the effects Lucas later used in the Star Wars films.
Wow! What an insane clip! We’re both new and upcoming gaming video creators and really wish we could hit some clips like this ourselves! I’ve checked out your page and really love your content and thought I’d drop you a like 😊😜

I WAS PLAYING THE SIMS 3 AND MY NEIGHBOURS NAME IS GAVIN PINKERTON 😳😳 I married him
He doesnt exist... The guy is just crazy
The guy asking if you've seen Gavin, is actually Gavin himself. He just has horrible memory loss.
Cain eats gavin
Maybe Gavin's friend is "Gavin" 🌚
Gavin is the big foot on ambarino
Gavin, well my dad was riding down the street and the man was saying Gavin, has anyone seen Gavin and there was a dead man on the side of the road. So sir I think I found Gavin
"When i saw the fucker in New Austin, I went ahead and shot him and looted him, he had a note and what i can make out from it, Gavin is dead."
Tahiti
Gavin is the Wolf man
His bodies in thieves landing people found it already
If you kill or hogtie him he has a letter
Gavin ded
Me and my brother think Charles got into a fight with Gavin
Gavin is the camera when you control Arthur
Who the fuck is Gavin 🤔🤔
@gavmanjohn here he is
Gavin went to Tahiti.😂😂 #justajoke
Captured by fussars men in guarma, he went there to find the almighty statue of the English bloke
Guarma
@kristen_faith6 along the roanoke valley river, right next to wear it says roanoke on the map
@the_non_bilingual_weeb Gavin's friend said that Gavin is ab English man🤔.....I don't think that's Dutch
@aminnourshargh Arthur have a photo of his father holding a plate with the name "Morgan" on it
Gavin is Trelawny
@osama_messi10 Like I said it's one of his covers, wouldn't be too hard to fake an English accent
@the_non_bilingual_weeb maybe u r right.....I would do anything to hear Dutch talking English😂😂
Gavin was abducted by aliens or snatched up by night-folk 😭😂 @stormbraver638
Gavin got murdered by that guy you had to find with maps. Or he was killed by the incest people
Probably his imaginary friend
He's on some good shit
@osama_messi10 it's a random dude that Dutch made Arthur to believe that he was his father
Tahiti or Australia.
I need a friend like him
Arthur killed gavin at some point in the game and pretends to not know where he is (just a theory doe 👀)
In the saloon when all the people morph into lenny, one of the people who morph is gavin, gavin lenny doesn't turn back after the mission is over, and when the real lenny gets grabbed by the law he is sentenced to hanging, gavin Lenny decides to switch real lenny with himself and be part of the gang while the real lenny is dead
At your moms house
🤣🤣🤣
I think he’s the crazy old man you can find living with wolves
Gavin went to Tahiti
Y'all ever have Nigel show up by Murfree Brood territory as Arthur?
I think Gavin is who found Arthur when he has TB in chapter 5
Gavin was one of Dutch's fake names, he promised him they would travel around the world, then took his shit and disappeared. Which is why this guy goes to places Dutch has made a name for himself (Deputy in Rhodes and Most Wanted in Blackwater)
I've probably killed gavin tbh
What if Arthur is the real Gavin but he lost his mind by an accident years ago and Dutch gave him his new fake name. Arthur Morgan!😨
Poland😂
@hxrley_johno ok
Gavin is in Tahiti
Hes Gavin
@topoyiyoc the one who found him in the street of Saint Denis or the other one? Bc the other one is the german father from the family that he helped before Clemens Point
In Tahiti farming mangoes with Dutch
@maxaroniofficial the one who found him in the street i think he is him bcuz gavin's friends says he is a englishman and the one who found Arthur dress like a englishman so i think he is him
@topoyiyoc I genuinely don’t think that Rockstar actually made a Gavin 😂 they just made poor Gavin’s friend suffer lol but I like your theory!! That’s interesting, I’d never considered it
I think nigel killed him
Gavin is the Online male character
@smalladvantages
@maxaroniofficial Thanks :D !!
@maxaroniofficial In my second playtrough i noticed that and i said thats is GAVINNNNNNN
Gavin is a metaphor for the good ending of the Red Dead series: we keep looking but we'll never find it
I hate Nigel
@gary.baily oh dang I wanna find that. Where about is it?
I believe he appeared once, to help Arthur to the doctor. Evidence to back up my theory: Both wearing similar clothes, Gavin’s friend says he’s an Englishman, the guy that shows up to help Arthur is infact an Englishman
Area 51
Tahiti!
@lil.yuzu do you know the true story behind it?
Gavin is on area 51😂
There is no Gavin 😂
I think Gavin had a rough night and is lost and he’s trying to find him
Trelawny 🧐😅
Gavin went to the Aberdeen pig farm, the end.
Dead.
@66dark_soul66 nope
The ware wolf man in the cave or Nigel killed him
That Arthur is gavin with memory loss
He's Gavin
Gavin is a god
He is gavin
@gary.baily there’s a werewolf man?
@twitchy_dcofficial I never noticed rhis
6 feet under
@kristen_faith6 you find a naked man with a wolf that attacks you, then if you go to his cave you’ll go in and turn around and he’ll be standing there and set wolves on you, he’s feral and referred to as the werewolf or wolf man
It makes me sad and angry at the same Time
Driving Alberto Fussar crazy in Guarma. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think he had schizophrenia or something and he just hallucinated that Gavin was there, but then he got cured and Gavin disappeared
I think he is gavin and is crazy 😝
He has multiple personalities disorder
@lil.yuzu i was thinking the same thing
Either Gavin is dead or got sick of him and ditched him
Tahiti
More please!

Gente, non fermatevi ai numerini. Guardate i caricamenti sul cambio visuale di tempesta, la maggior lentezza nel caricare le texture nella stessa, il fatto che se sei sotto fuoco nemico e tu getti in copertura, come succedeva all'inizio, muori lo stesso
@alessandro.franceschini02
@31adivisione_battlefield Ma quelli sono "al limite" problemi di netcodeed hit-reg. A livello di ping a me è tornato normal
@alessandro.franceschini02 cioè, se io pingo 25. dopo lo scorso aggiornamento andavo a 60. Ma comunque chi pingava 300 non mi uccideva dietro i muro e i colpi miei entravano. Ora post aggiornamento il mio ping è sceso a 25 di nuovo però, chi pinga 300, è diventato avvantaggiato, uccidendomi in ritardo e missando i colpi in sagoma se in movimento. Il problema è stato risolto o ne è stato creato uno molto più grave?
Io vado da dio, se qualcuno ti uccide dopo che ti sei riparato dietro ad un muro vuol dire che ti dovevi togliere di mezzo prima. La posizione del giocatore che conta è quella del server, non quella in cui ti vede l'avversario che lagga. Non diciamo cazzate per favore.
@nonno_bale se ricevo un colpo e mi sdraio, non posso ricevere il secondo a terra, Dietro la copertura, quando ho 20 di ping. Dio*****
@nonno_bale con la patch con cui sistemarono il netcode il problema era sparito. Ora. Magicamente, torna
@31adivisione_battlefield puoi eccome, vuol dire che dovevi essere più veloce. Ripeto: la posizione che conta di un giocatore è quella frutto della connessione fra il tuo modem e il server. L'avversario che lagga ti vede magari ancora in piedi ma il suo colpo non può proprio tecnicamente entrare se il server ha registrato la tua posizione da sdraiato
@nonno_bale la gente che riporta ciò si abbassa o scatta come faceva prima della patch, solo che ora muore. Prima no 😂 gente con 600h di gioco. Non 12
Dopo l'ultimo aggiornamento in verità sento molto di più le hit che subsco e riesco tranquillamente a coprirmi senza essere shottato, quindi al livello di netcode/hitreg il gioco mi sembra migliorato e il ping è tornato come un tempo, quindi posso dire tranquillamente che gli unici problemi che riscontro durante le partite sono relativi al bilancio delle armi e texture lente a caricare, niente di troppo fastidioso
@31adivisione_battlefield va bene dai, sarà il fantasma formaggino che fa gli scherzetti

@justin.vgs not sure but I thiiiiink the terrain is modelled in 3D and then the objects are 2D with a bunch of different angles drawn that it cycles through when you rotate the camera?

Thanks you

@paulchilds67 Agreed 👌
Bat-Kenobi
Read the Kenobi book. It’s about him on Tat while Luke is a baby & it’s really good.
@jedi_master_kenobi great book
@jimmayk33 exactly, good book
Y’all really just gonna forget about Sharad Hett? The Tusken Raider Jedi? They could easily add him to canon and make an amazing story arc
@jackhhale read the comics (which is canon) and read Kenobi (legends but still a damn good read) and we know the general idea of what he was doing (besides keeping an eye on Like and becoming one with the Force). Besides, him and Yoda are in exile so nothing too adventurous wis gonna happen to him.
@forevernerd17 i mean do you think theyd really make a show with him doing nothing? Theyre gonna make it exciting
decanonize rebels
probably helped his self esteem issues
@buffalodelorean thats funny
@endeavour_iv thanks
@buffalodelorean god i wish
Good guy wan.
The comics say that he fought off bounty hunters and thugs, most of the time using a lightsaber. How does no one go to the Empire and say “some old bastard on Tatooine lopped off my friend’s arm and force pushed me away, pretty sure he’s a Jedi, Mr. Palpatine.” How was he never found 🤔 guess that could be the plot of the show
They'll probably retell the stories from the comics and tell the Maul thing from his point of view
Hopefully they recreate the maul scenes in live action.
@zeno.zach I wonder the same.
And absolutely no one is surprised by this, this is so in character for him. 
It will be interesting and captivating because it’s an extension of who Obi-Wan is. In whatever situation he’s in, he always goes above and beyond. He treats people with kindness and respect. He’s willing to get involved at a personal level that most Jedi among his peers ignored. Obi-Wan was human in a way the other Jedi were not, this story is about Obi-Wan as a person, a man, a grieved man, a man who never gives up, a man who takes care of others selflessly, a man who holds onto who he is even when no one is watching or when it’s really hard. He is capable of seeing the potential in people and tries to bring that out. He’s charming and funny, and is really responsible for some of the brightest and best moments in the saga. He carried the baton when no one else could and got little thanks for it, but he did his part well. He’s a marvelous character and I can’t wait to explore him.
Why do you use girl emojis ur a dude also there’s literally the rest of his life they can do besides his exile lmao
Vigilante.
@michael_macesuck it’s been revealed that they r only covering his time in exile
@michael_macesuck the rest of his life.......episode 1-3 or a flash in the pan in episode 4. I'm all for any and all star wars content but i feel the same as @starwars_factz on this one
@michael_macesuck imagine getting upset about Emojis.
It’s the least he could do after letting the republic fall.
@starwars_factz He also used the Force to tame a Krayt Dragon and save a settlement of Sand People.
The Kenobi book is good.  They could add other adventures along with everything from the book.
Its a made up world, TV can do anything, no point getting all picky and fanbouy over details....
Maybe he just counted the sand in Tatooine
We have no idea all he did on tatooine. Thats why theyre making the show
Read Kenobi. I'm hoping they adapt some of that stuff.
@paulchilds67 details are what make franchises like this so much fun though
Should have made an Obi wan and Qui Gon series based on Jedi Apprentice books
They’ll probably go over his training to become a force ghost like they showed in from a certain point of view
@ebrahim_master I thought they already have
@kaynan.maurice yes i love the books canon and old, but not gonna cry when its not as imagined, too many complain, but you cant please all, personally glad there is anything at all!

My favorite was Ascension due to the super bounces. In a custom games I combined 27 super bounces all around the map but this was back in 2005. Least favorite would be Ivory Tower since I could never figure out how in double team 2 people could have eyes on the entire map.

I remember being young doing 4 pkayer split screen with my dad and two brothers and my dad always loved using the rocket spam technique
I love ascension
Oh not biggest fan of lockdown but love them all u gave me hard choice! 😂
Man I love the old school halo 💜
I spent an unhealthy amount of time on ascension but I love all 4 of them
Lockout for sure
@aalfreesalinas pura infancia
These were some of my favorite maps!!!
@lotay125 yes!!!! Lock out was the map bro!!!
@halotutor I loved super bouncing bro!!! Had a set of jumps in every map!!!
Grandes recuerdos
The love hate on those maps
@keanu_reeves_stolen_memes I love Ascension, but all of these maps definitely deserve attention
Lockout all day long! Love each new version from each game that followed.
Lockout i was untouchable
They’re all iconic
Midship is abysmal and no one can prove me wrong
@burakkusutibu @dont_tatsumi
Lockout!
My halo 2 & all time favourite map is not on this list but it’s called ‘HEADLONG’. My favourite outta these is ‘ASCENSION’ & worst is ‘midship’. idk I’ve never like any of the covi maps🤷🏻‍♂️😊
Lockout
@ice1umar Headlong was fun as hell for objective game modes.
@ice1umar Headlong was fun as hell for objective game modes.
@xhunter218 true but I preferred it for sniper battles & the map had a good feel for snipers😊
Lockout
@ice1umar True. So many places to hide.
Warlock>>>>>>>>>>>>Ascension
@ricwinfield @carlostapiasali
@xhunter218 of course but you gotta be a great sniper to to keep up😁
I love ascension. I hate lockout

Just added this to my wishlist. I'm new to PC gaming, so this may help me
Wow that's useful 👌thx 💙
Bloody hell, thats some accuracy! Fastest fingers in the west! 😎
@karo_aka_nyktornal Very useful, it has diffrent training options depending on what you are wanting too improve. Tracking, flickshots, speed etc. 🤘 It's free too!!
@chaotis14 It will massively help you out. Just take your time, learn what grip style suits you and find a decent sensitivity then from there it's just small adjustments and practice. Good luck and have fun. 😀
@the_heart_is_our_home 🤣 Still got things too improve on. Can I take what I learn from Aimlab into a Online arena?

@geekpool_ Un rpg d'époque de la Dream Cast déjà remasterisé sur Game Cube 😁
@toms0_fr0m_nibelheim Merci mon pote 😁😁 ça fait plaisir a entendre quand j'ai l'impression qu'Instagram cloisonne de plus en plus.
@stupefilip Merci l'ami 😁
@sl0wn_ Merci ! Trop happy de l'avoir eu 😁😁
@cardosotaku 😁😁 J'avoue avoir eu un gros coup de bol car vu les prix  je le voulais sans trop le chercher mais bon la c'était l'occasion.
@x.ghostshadoow oh les boules !
J’y ai joué et je l’ai gardé ☺️ ce jeu est juste terrible 😍🔥
@shakollection C'est peu de le dire 😕
Sacrée prise bravo, un des jeux les plus recherchés de la GC et un bon jeu surtout côté univers
@_bearded.man GG tu a eu le nez fin de le garder car serieux c'est chaud de le trouver. C'est comme mon Baten Kaitos, quelle connerie m'est passée par la tête de le revendre.
@paroche.fzs Merci ! Ca devient super chaud de le trouver à prix raisonnable. C'est l'occasion d'aller fouiller dans le grenier de mes parents voir si ma vielle GC est toujours la peut-être que j'y retrouverais de belle choses 😁
Un jeu incroyable...belle prise! Je n’aurais jamais dû revendre mon exemplaire...
@gameseed1 Merci 😁 Pour quelle raison l'a tu vendu ?
@shakollection je l’ai aussi franchement j’ai du bol parce qu’il ne me reste plus beaucoup de jeu game cube mais cela on su résister à ma jeunesse 🤣
@_bearded.man 🤣🤣 Pas moi malheureusement. Baten Kaitos, Paper Mario, Windwaker.
@shakollection un déménagement j’ai dû faire du tri...y avait Baten Kaitos dans le lot 😢 j’ai plus qu’à espérer des remastered 😕
@gameseed1 oh merde 😅 Tkt les déménagements m'ont fait du tort aussi 😅
@shakollection jamais de regret mais je serai pas contre des versions Switch 😉
Joué sur Dreamcast et un régal ce RPG, j'ai adoré. Mais si un jour j'ai l'occasion de le trouver sur GC à un bon prix je le prendrais.
@retrogamefriends je te le souhaite ! 👍
Je connais juste de nom
Une petite folie ! ❤️ Tes photos ont tellement un impact 😱
Roh c’est beau ça 🤩
Content que tu es pu mettre la main dessus 😁 le jeu un rythme assez lent, mais l'histoire est cool donc ça compense.
Un jeu que j'aimerais vraiment posséder !!! 😭🤗 J'avais juste fais la version Dreamcast à l'époque et apparemment cette version sublime ce superbe titre 😍
@sl0wn_ a*
Haaaa super ça ! Quand je pense que je l'avais mais bon sans rentrer dans les détails on me l'a subtilement voler chez moi...
@x.ghostshadoow voler subtilement ? Un pote ou une ex j'imagine
@retrovladyyy Une connaissance que j'avais faites via un site de JV, il était de passage par la Belgique alors il est venu me dire bonjour, journée gaming, j'ai pas prêter attention et c'est quand j'ai voulu reposer la main dessus que je ne l'ai jamais retrouvé...
@lolita_coquette nah you aren't boring at all, I'm boring haha 😅 I never know what to say!!.
@louichan03 hahah I keep on just rambling thats all! 😓😅 you’re not boring dw!
@lolita_coquette I'll have to play music in the background hoping spotify wont cut out but I also dont have premium so ads....😭 like what you did. People wont like my music though hahaha
What system did you get it for? 😊 I brought it a couple of months ago & haven't got into yet! I figured it might be more fun with a friend! But It seems like such a cute/good game to get into, especially during the fall season :3
@_spookybat_ I got it on the ps4 😊
I play RDO to relax, Stardew Valley is a great pick too 🙌🎮
@louichan03 Awww! I have it for the switch. I was thinking about getting it for the ps4 though!
@_spookybat_ wellif you do let me know 😁
@louichan03 definitely 😊
Sims 4 has been strangely addicting 🤣 And Minecraft is always fun
🤔 Pokemon, I guess, or Spyro
Animal Crossing is so relaxing to me!! 💕💕💕🌸
I love this game 😍👍
Any Nintendo game is super relaxing for me. Enjoy! 💜
I love it 💕 I'm not doing so well so I'm currently playing it all the time. Maybe you saw it on playstation 😂💕
@satanspg.gaming oh no I hope you feel better soo 😊❤️
@kawineko thank you❤️
@milkysora_ oh yes! ❤️
@empi_gaming oh yes they're great. The sims 4 is mine for sure, well if glitches aren't happening haha
Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley are great relaxing games 😍💚✨
Yayy! 🙌🏻 Definitely this is my go-to for relaxing as you saw 😅
Ohhhh i need to get this... 😀
@lolita_coquette yes!!! Hopefully it does the same to me 😁 awesome stream btw
@m3lzii6 what will you get it on?❤️
You will love it! It’s one of my favorite games 💜
@pixie.leee I hope so 😁💜
@louichan03 aw thank you so much! Youre so lovely! I always feel like I’m boring everyone 😂 cant wait to see your stardew stream!

:O you must win if not I’m suing. This. Is. Amazing.
@_art_e_facts_ thanks!!! ❤️❤️. I try to generate an appearance for alex (and the rest of the character) that felt shared, because drawing a minimalist character like alex next to a super complex and full of detail creature like Alien didn't feel right
U so wining so much talent
@kreativ.artzz Thanks for the support 💞 I appreciate it very much. I try my best in this drawing, hopefully that's enough hahaha
@itzymations_studios Thanks fellow artist!! I hope you're right, it would be so cool to win 😂
Oh my god I’m this is insane. I will be shocked if you don’t win something.
@thebluelock I am sure u win already
@itzymations_studios hopefully he will make the winners public soon (I don't handle the suspense well, if I lose fine, but I want to know now!!! Hahaha)

Song
“I’m in danger”
@nintendo_sage
Is it actually possible
The closest i got was red shell frenzy and it was free game tbh
Everything about this image strikes fear and anxiety in me 😩
@gabriel_.fung idk, but its scary
What happens if YOU are the first one?
What in the actual fuck is this for real!!
Lightning frenzy is better no cap from last place to first with a x60 combo don’t even
@gabriel_.fung yes I got it this afternoon
Is it possible to get special time frenzies like a shit ton of bowser shells
But what happens if you fuck the first place and now YOU'RE in first🤔
What would happen if you threw the shells backwards
I got like 3 frenzy in a row in one game this afternoon
@yu_mii_us yeah
A blue shell frenzy would leave me crying
Red shell frenzy is just as scary
@yu_mii_us yo I actually got bowser shell frenzy it was so OP
what's yall score in ranking cup?
Eing in first...
Amen
You start to feel G E N U I N E  F E A R
Uhm......
Imagine turning around while you’re in first place to see an entire fleet, a whole armada of blue shells flying at your helpless car
I shit myself when I saw this
The closest you can get to hacking without hacking

@prince.nadim01 ahaha thats what I thought was gonna happen but oof
@letsanimateit_88 its a biome?
@ioni.borislavova I 100% agree fucking hate the game 😂😂
@stoned_gamer64 but I’m a broke uni student got to secure the bag somehow 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
The sand thing is gonna be a new Minecraft trend
Making obsidian isn’t satisfying unless you’re in a cave or ravine
@stoned_gamer64 oof that’s sad 😂
I was thinking of starting youtube too but first i need to buy a better spec pc so it can handle games and obs at the same time
Second no even got time since working and school so oof
@stoned_gamer64 i will sub for u tho
@studiomoontv tu vidím kopírovanie 😂😂❤️

You cant fall forever i. Minecraft
You literally just stole mumbo jumbos video
Me gusta mucho! Te felicito.
First
Elytra is satisfying until you accidentally hit a wall because it didn't rendered yet
Was the second one a map or biome
Second map seed pls
@repuraccoon ❤️
@muminkwy it’s in the game just do a lot of exploring it should be by the sand biome
Where's RTX
Why are you TORCHuring sand🤣
@u_r_idot I think its a biome
@pewdiepie
@saidsimaoui
@krr.lll
Can’t find the end city:(

Forza horizon
@gamingbeacon Cyberpunk only if I can hang with Keanu Reeves
@lego_beard I miss fable!!
Hellooo new page💯🔥
https://mixer.com/CapitaoSchulz
I mean living in the skyrim universe would be nice because it's so damn pretty. Butttt there's always something out to kill you
Fallout 4 bc u can respawn and never die
Either Assassin's Creed, Gears of War, or The Legend of Zelda. Wait.. Halo!! I can't  decide between my 4 favorite franchises.
@tha_5th_of_march So many to pick from 😁
😍😍😍😍😍
Easy, Gears of War.
Destiny for sure!🤙🏻
Forza Horizon 4. I. Am. Speed.
Halo minus the human genocide
@hewittpablo Hahaha nice!
Anything Rockstar then 👍
@thorsrighteye How about the others if you can respawn 😁

Sometimes I don’t wanna live my life, but I can’t imagine living in another world. There’s so much pain, but the small and good things makes me so happy that I can’t even imagine living in another place that isn’t my Earth.
I best stay sad for a while so I won’t go crazy trying to find this comment in the future and removing it
i would love to live in red dead redemption 2
Animal crossing would be pretty cool. A nice sense of community and doing little jobs for your neighbors and getting paid in flowers or fish sounds amazing 😂
This sounds stupid and all but fallout 4 just the wasteland part I have always loved post apocalypse games like fallout 3and 4
Animal crossing or resident evil
Since DOOM Eternal’s almost coming out I’d say I’d live in DOOM 2016 for now until then, gotta pass the time by chopping up some demons😂
🤔🤔Mario world because there’s lots of gold coins just lying around every where, I’d be a millionaire in no time
Prolly GTA V or RD2 or LA noire
Minecraft
Dragon Age 👌👌
Halo, no wait I’d probably die, Borderlands, no wait again, GoW, no wait... hmm this is tricky 🤔, Forza Horizon 😂
I would love to be in ghost recon
@xboxunlocked custom built drifting BMW
Gears 5
@j0hnnyj34r yeah I'd wanna be clayton

Lo logras jugando duelo con amigos, en 10 duelos ya está pronto. Yo lo hice con un amigo anteanoche
¿En qué parte de la película aparece ese gordo otaku? Ndeahh
@alyox_music sii también sirve jugar duelos con amigos! Es aún más facil asi 😅
@critiasfang si! Yo lo hice así con un amigo (una vez cada uno así lo desbloqueabamos ambos)
@salzano_lucas en el principio practicamente, lo mata Aigami
Que desperdicio de memoria es tener a este gordo como personaje
@sappyu.u grax
@salzano_lucas esta de ruta
@critiasfang ¿Posta? No sé qué habilidades tiene
@salzano_lucas yo tampoco jaja creo que no tiene nada de especial sinceramente
@critiasfang creo que lo hicieron de relleno para que no estén solamente Kaiba y Mokuba. Puede que saque a Aigami o Yugi en un evento más adelante

So cool and awesome! 👏💖
@nerdy__crafter thank you!!
Can't wait for Breakout!! Beta was fun 👍
@xboxunlocked I have to agree. I wasn’t feeling the best this past weekend and didn’t get to put in as much time as I would have liked, however, what I did play was fun. It would be great with a crew.
@answerthetullyphone we will need to squad up this weekend 👍💯
Great game, only a little confusing at the start. Wish I could still play it.

Best portable emulator ever.
Dude I had the illest trance songs on my old psp.... then some fat chick fluffing stole it
😭
I have ten, not including the broken ones😬. I might have a problem
It's funny, to the untrained eye most of the psp revisions all look the same but in the flesh, the 3000 looks and feels so good. I'm pretty fond of the psp go too.
2000s vibes
@lilchungus218 damn lol
@animenoodle 👍🏼😎
@champagnepeine all of us collectors have a problem 😂
@joebleeps ya its crazy how much lighter it is then the 1000
This was years ahead of its time. Was never fully appreciated and I’d love them to make a new version 👊🏼👊🏼
I had one but didn't like most games on it. I mainly used it as a retro gaming emulator and for Crisis Core. 🤷🏽‍♂️
My favorite console all time, specifically the God of War PSP 2000 and the Star Wars PSP 2000 🔥🔥🔥 #psp
I have the God of War PSP 2000 the Star Wars PSP 2000, a vibrant blue PSP 3000 and the black PSP Go! #PSP
How much is it
still got my original one on day of release waited for GAME to open at midnight. Then issued a raffle ticket if your number was selected you could buy one (still play burnout every now and then now)
I think I have the matte black variant of this lil beast, it is pretty noisy tho when the disc starts spinning along 😂👌
sure did, my first psp slim broke and i never got to play again but im building a collection so i may buy one AGAIN 😅
I owned multiple PSPs back in the day! It definitely rivaled the DS for me. Beautiful shot as always, funny we both decided to post some non-nintendo content today 🙌🤘
@s.advro oh no! im still on the lookout for a psp go 👌🏼
🤗
😲
Yes psp 1000 when I was in 7th grade and today I'm 27 and still got it and it works perfect
@gbguyamil today your 27 like its your birthday?
Still got my first gen PSP!! 😉
@cizzle_d_vizzle nice! its crazy how much lighter these 3001’s are than the 1001’s, those OG’s are tanks!
@b_b_retro be on the lookout my guy @moddedmarsh may peek ur interest🙏🏾🔥
There is it ! Very nice ! I have this one too!
Had a psp1000 when they came out but he got stolen later in life 😭
@b_b_retro hahaha nooo i'm just saying that i'm 27
I still have a psp go
@b_b_retro they definitely are!!

LOVED this game ❤️
@wurstpersonshooter I've never actually played it. Lol. I'll need to check it out when I plug my Sega back in.
I think the graphic is very incredible as a past generation game.
@sk_switchup I agree! They did a great job on the graphics!
@sk_switchup It was definitely one of those games that pushed visuals in my opinion.
Definitely a classic in my opinion
@playstationguy87 @chaotis14 I remember back then when there were some games that pushed the console to the limit and those game were really amazing for somes like Doom.
This game was amazing as a kid... Still amazing now
Hard to believe the OG #toystory was released that long ago...#gettingold
I didn't get to play this but u played toy story on the N64 and loved it!
@the.bearded.gamer I still remember seeing it in theater the day it came out.
Okay now I'm confused....I didn't think I had played this but now looking at the screenshot I've got the vaguest of recollections 🤔 perhaps I did 😂
Never played it on anything other than ps1 and that was absolutely nails 😂
I used to play this!! Wow that’s a blast from the past 🤘🏻
@gamerdad16 I'm all about hitting you with those nostalgic feels.
@chaotis14 and it feeelllsss good brother 🤙🏻

I love Radiant Historia❤️. The story is incredible! It's too bad that not many people has play it 😐. I like both the artwork of the original game and the remake but I prefer Eruca's original design. I really love her short hair.
More people should play this game. I've been thinking of getting the 3DS port. I loved my first go on the DS. ❤️
I spent only an hour playing the demo and fell in love with it on 3DS. I bought it soon after and def need to play it at some point! 😍

@crankyeagle yeah, I don’t know what happened there. Maybe it was when I decided I was “too cool” for my DS? 😅 but I have all the core games now because Pokémon is life 😍
I'd need the list, but off the top of my head... probably Pignite. That motherfucker rolling around in a top hat and cane the first time I saw a talent show was hilarious.
@eeramz haha yeah I had one of those phases too when I was like 14 😂 Pokemon IS life! Hope you love the games when you get around to them! 😍
@samuelryanlilly haha yes!! I really like Pignite too. He's probably the best middle evo of the gen 5 starters
@crankyeagle He's probably the best middle evolution of any line. How often is the middle one any good!?
I personally haven’t played jt because I’m not a big pokemon fan but it looks cool ☺️
Emolga is my favourite Pokémon of all time! 💛💛💛
Such a gorgeous shot 😍
Zekrom and Samurott ❤️
I’m not the biggest fan of Gen V’s designs, but my favourite pokemon is Galvantula, ironically 😄
Whimsicott, vanillite and Scoliopede for sure!
Amazing shot! 😍🖤
Gen 5 does deserve more love 💖 my fav gen 5 Pokémon is Dewott
Very clean and beautiful shot Rachel I never play that games before but im sure they are so good!
I don't like Black and White but girl you slayed this shot 😍😍
I absolutely love all 3 of the starters as well as their evolutions 😍
Beautiful 😍
I feel like this generation didn’t last long at all, but the details were awesome!
Krokorok 😊
One of the best and most underrated generations
This is my most favorite generation

@stor_aged_games it's one of my faves as well, it's so underrated!! 😍
@eeramz oh really? The games are great! I definitely recommend Black 2 or White 2 bc they made a lot of improvements over the originals 💕

Nice! Can you do a rom swap on a regular board to convert to the special?
😍 👍🏻 One of my favs on the Saturn. Cool to see it live on a cab. At least I have a way of playing it in Tate properly 😁

Imagine pretending that DS2 is in any way better than DS3. 🐸
“Buttom beside R1”. This was made by a DS2 fan.
@cocacampbell you can tell it was cause 3 is obviously better
Lies those images are
@a_fine_dark_soul_ 3 is indeed better than 2
Ds3 has almost all of those features
@cameron.capizzi yea there’s blasphemy in this picture
“Good pvp”🤡🤡🤡
As much as I like ds3, ds2 has BY FAR the best character creation in series. You get less options, but it's a lot easier to make a character that doesn't look like garbage.
Fuuuck I would've applied if I knew
@corey_poirier_vapes I'm on the fence about it. I'll let you know my thoughts. Was hoping for a RE Outbreak styled game.
Interesting
Wow

Have you heard of the high elves
0/10 no giant smile on his face
*Zooms in intensely*
The most time they just walk away 😅
Wait, why do his eyes change color...?
😂😂
Very accurate
the third image makes me feel sonething
did his eye color change?
Lol
The classic zoom 😂😂
Thank u kind sir
@gnawsguz
Did the eye color change?😂
polls on my story if you’re bored
By Azura, By Azura...
Oh.. it's yooOOOUU!

@donall_ohaiseadha it's the grand champion!
Hice to change the facial expresion in a second
The fact that they just goes stare right into your soul and feels like breaking the 4th wall is even creepier

Nice Shot Bro I have heard Only good Things about it enjoy and have a great week 🎮💙🙋🏻‍♂️
👏👏👏👏👏
😮😮😮😮😮
New one by me, hope you liked it!
Have you tried it? A lot of these games lack polish but at their core are pretty damn enjoyable and great value for the time you can put in
I heard this was good...need to get my hands on it👍👍👍
Nice, I definitely want to play this soon
Finished now on Xbox One. Nice game!
Nice bro!!! Gotta try this one never heard of it to be honest 🔥🙌🏼
@casadeben Not as of yet been busy trying to finish the Gears 5 main story campaign. The production on this one is not as great as some of the higher end development studios but reviews have been decent which justified the purchase.
@dagou1980 Thanks my friend and I agree the cover looks awesome and I can't wait to play.
@sparda1981 Thanks bro, I was reading the reviews on this one for a while and scores have been positive hence the reason why I decided to go ahead and pick it up.
@amindr150 👍🎮
@video_juegosfj 👍🎮
@ashevent Thanks Rick, not much promotion behind this one but I am a sucker for games developed by lesser known studios.
@dealhshand I was sold on the fact that it had a character creation mode plus a decent story.
@hcxgaming Awesome I have this one  in my backlog and will get to it soon.
@enrico_vanni That was quick it was just released last week. 😀
@iwantthatretro Thanks bro honestly I don't think many people heard of this one. Games like this tend to fly under the radar when there is no big marketing or promotion.
@gl1tch_gaming not sure if you ever played risen 3. Caught a lot of flak but at its core it was a blast
A good game with excellent cover 😉

@imstealthyslothxiii dude this next season is going to be legit!  So I hear there will be key card you can obtain to gain access to Legendary loot rooms 👏 just wait until we play caustic and wraith together and trap people in those rooms 😆
Damn those laser beams in the beginning tho 👌🔥
@fake_uchiha117 eh.. I missed a few shots with the wingman. I was trying to learn the hip fire prediction with it.
@michaelloganbrooks oh man yeah that's gonna be crazy. Can't wait to run some games with you soon man!💪
@djangoplayys same man. 😅 It's an on and off thing for me. I gotta get those hip fires down. I probably should crouch though
Laser beams for days 😂
@dueceswildbill all except for the wingman. I was practicing my hipfires with it an realized I need to work on them lmaoo
Fucking Beautiful My Guy!!!!

@tone.v.s.supermarioworld82  slay !! Feel huged greetings from Pretzelland 💕🌈💪🏻 ,👨🏼👧🏼👏🏻
Ngl I like Jor
@jimmy_d4rling and that’s A-Okay.
But Jor urks me severely for the reasons above.
Someone finally said it, I’ll spam dodge knowing the bash is coming after getting hit by a light and it’ll still hit me
Finally someone who agrees and doesn’t say “jUst blOcK anD GeT guD”
@sean.tackett because Ubi decided to give Jor an uber spammable 50/50. They’d probably not be my most hated character if they did not have superior lights.
@mr.bent.cent the bash it just so fast and the second light is free if you try to spam dodge expecting a bash. And you’re fucked once your oos
@uber.soldatv4 well blocking is irrelevant to Jor’s 50/50 as they have superior lights.
Once you block that light you have to decide if they’re gonna do the bash or the light.
Jor is not a character that you can’t “just block.” They’re a character that you have to continually win a coin flipping match against.
@mr.bent.cent I understand, I was just saying an example.
Keep on preaching man, truer words hath never been uttered
And if u Spam dodge attacks the 2nd light of her will welcome you lmao
@zlovealpha really no counter for her.
I just hate Jor because shes completely tard proof and whoever slams their face on their controller the most seems to win
I hate jorm cuz the bash has no animation
Hitokiris 50/50 is worse.
I don’t mind Jörmungandr.
@michael.divaio the problem with their respective 50/50’s is that Jor can access it on any light that isn’t parried.
Hito at least has to land an attack to access hers.
@aaron_van_ginkel that's a pretty good description
Huge bee update 🤤
Wait actually?
I would use my college savings to buy this
@gamerslegacy
Real shit?
@redhydra803 yes watch xisumavoids video
@alec.sherratt jep 😎
But still no word about ps4 bedrock
I think more they update Minecraft mod it become trash
I'm pissed cuz my switch won't connect to the internet
I took your as advice, bought the outlaw pass and became a trader. It's so much fun and I'm getting a lot of XP and Monet
Bien aventurados los pacificos👌
@nolanchristenson oh, yay!😊 Collector is really good too. The metal detector and shovel are quite expensive, but you should make plenty of money through Trader to buy them, if you decide you’d like to go for that sometime :)
@mrsarthurmorgan yeah I started the collector also, but I play it passively. I tend to find a lot of special items on my hunts
I miss Arthur. I want to load a save where he’s alive but can’t bring myself to do it. Like losing someone in real life, he’s gone and I just have to deal with it
Excuse me while I immediately go recreate this outfit
hey! i have an outfit i’d like you to post if you’d want 💓 i’m not sure how to like,, submit it though. would i dm you an image along with the description of what he’s wearing? thank youu

Do you like the Lite more than the original switch? I primarily play mine in hand held mode and am seriously considering trading it in for a lite.
Switch lite? I want one too... I don’t have a switch yet and I’m thinking maybe a Lite would suit my tastes more bc I prefer handheld consoles
This is so adorable 😊💗
Your nails are so gorgeous ❤️ and agreed, I can’t travel without a system (your Splatoon case is gorgeous)!
@l1n3ina I do! I have small hands and as a handheld gamer it’s much better for that imo :)
@katystraub the only thing I ever really do as far as playing in another mode that's not handheld is playing tabletop every so often but really handheld is the main way I go with my switch. Hm, ok cool thanks gives me some more to ponder on. The switch does get a bit heavy for my head from time to time. And when it came to the 3ds lineup I loves the 2ds and that's what the lite reminds me of.
Oh it's so cute. Your nails look fabulous.
That switch is the prettiest 😍
Ah I want your bag so badly !
Your nails are so gorgeous 🔥

@christianr2029 No I haven’t buddy, is it any good? I like that they have introduced new outfits for free tho!! 🔥
@swoosh_plays its equally as good as the main game. I just didn't want it to come to an end and it whacks another 10 hours onto the game 👍
I need to get back to finishing that game.  Nice post mate 👍
@christianr2029 sounds good bro thank you!
@gamingwithdaughters tell me about it, I’m trying to finish off some back log before destiny 2 dlc and cod 😭😭 only just started borderlands 3 as well 😂
Loved this game! Need to go back and 100% it and do the DLC.

@scarletsprites absolutely!
@retro_librarian_gamer this is a very unpopular opinion but I am not a huge fan of Nintendo. I typically keep the SNES classic at my library in the children’s room for patrons to enjoy.
@chunwahkong great minds think alike!

Worse cache ever
Cache said: Aztec
Its fucking ugly i hate
@sr.rafild
That's a shit, now this is a CT map and terrorists need to find some pixel to Pic mid
Nah
@viictor_om real.

Nope.
Cache
Much color
@thekizi ya
@matze_erhart bluedoor
@ludvig.perssson ohh i c thx
Very Bad
Didnt know hahaha
What the fuck have the done to my favorite map. They took de_cache and turned it to fucking fortnite.
@hueyscinema dude i didnt want a change except for minor prop movements for new positions and boosts. Thats it. They fucking turned my boy into fortnite.
Shrek 🙂 this is shit
@luckymalviann_ Steam
Erangel v2
This looks like cache before the old cache
Good idea, i like this bullshit
It's lit
Fuck this game
I would be down
@someshx by that same logic, the colorful ass facelift that Inferno got turned it into fortnite. The gameplay is still CSGO, and the new Cache is tonally and thematically consistent. It looks like Cache has been abandoned for half a century
@hueyscinema dude do you not see how cartoony that thing gonna look on low end pcs.
@someshx Cache would require way more than a reboot to make it run and look well on low end PCs
de_greenache
de_aztec
@mohammad_saeed24 looks more like a reskin than a remake
When i can playing this game 😢
Looks like any generic map now, lost its charm. gg
Look like a boarder land map
Dope af
Minecraft's mossy cobblestone sum up
@delano_apa true
de_templerun
thats dope i like
I dont get why everyone hates it. I guess you were all expecting a complete theme change like there has been with many of the other maps. I for one love cache, it might be my favorite map to play on competitively. I think this is a great facelift to the slightly-degraded Soviet outpost we knew before. Looks more like Pripyat now.
Nice apperance but way too vibrant in color. Needs less contrast and saturation to give it a colder, more appropriate feel.
whats on the second pic?
How much vibrance do you want?
Valve: yes
Crossfire be like:
20 fps
@bulyaki_gergely 2080ti is a massive exaggeration
@_korhonen__
@viictor_om BRUH🤡
catch remake?!😐
Got Aztec vibes when i saw it
@lervaboi october 10
low fps, ugly TO colorful , the players 75% cant afford a 2080 TI to play
@swaggy.player_ F
looks like csgo source
What the fuck are u?!

@taras.hex gone, reduced to atoms
They fucked cache too, very nice!
Looks like temple run.
@bulyaki_gergely how did you know that about low FPS?

@viictor_om real, there was a show match yesterday bruh

o please my fps is already bad
Best remake ever 🔥
I don't like it :(
When it comes out to game
Rip $2 potatoes that barely run csgo
New?
Where is simples grafity?
I don't really like it, maybe a bit, but.. 😂
😢
@dntbothaa same, I'm loving these nostalgic remasters 🙌🏻🙌🏻🔥🔥🖤🖤

Didn’t also saw it coming he was like a father figure to Altair. He’s such a unique and interesting character.
Love this edits it gives me chills every time
Me neither
Yeah... I was shock too.. I mean he was just like Altair's father!
Guess what I don't like both 😂
Yea it was a good shock when i first played. But it makes sense like how did he know where the apple would be.
I got a question, when Altair burn the body of AlMualim (which is against their faith to burn bodies), is it because Altair hasn't acquire knowledge about the apple, thinking AlMualim is a phantom?

@marc_olino._ vorrai dire del mondo!
@bornhub.elite sì hai ragione, chiedo venia
Ho capito bene???
ci sono volute 4 ore per riuscire a succhiarmi il mio pene. Ma è tutto diverso adesso.  Appena è avvenuto il contatto pene-bocca ho sentito una scossa lungo il mio corpo. Adesso credo di avere la super forza e la telecinesi. 3 ore dopo il contatto ho notato un furgone parcheggiato sulla mia strada ma nessuno è entrato o uscito dall'auto dal suo arrivo. Ho paura per la mia salvezza, non sono sicuro in che sorta di poteri potrei andare contro  ma è possibile che il governo lo abbia già scoperto. Se non aggiorno -è finito il messaggio non si hanno avuto più notizie di questa leggenda. @so_de_bresa
@sarocchiat penso di si😂

Any good? I did enjoy untill dawn :)
@exodus100 yeah I really enjoyed it, it’s not to long either so can play with friends over an evening (possibly 2)
@justjustinisms nice! We are chattinv in our group ( out gaymer bristol group ) about playing together someday. An trying out the demo out lol
Je suis d'accord avec toi !!! Première opus qui ne comporte que 4 acte. Le choix final, qui pour moi n'a aucun intérêt, est à 5mn de la fin !!
@judgeme1ster il reste meilleur que le 4, en tout cas plus mémorable, mais un peu raté
@le_vibromaster C'est vrai mais la fin du 5 ma déçu, celle du 4 un peu moins !!
Seriously, you take the best diving photos. Look at those colors!!!
@wearecroft1 ack! Thank you so much man! I really wish I could get one with that classic swan dive feel but she just doesn't do it lol
@gamergirlshots Yes, it doesn’t give the classic swan dive feels but it’s still kinda cool to have dive back in the game with Rise
@wearecroft1 yup yup yup!
Come dive with me, we'll fall down to Peruuuuuu 😁
@iridium_flair yaaaas💓💓👏👏👏
Omg!!! This is beautiful!!! The environment above the water being so clear and all these colors just stop this is so good!!😱😍
@scionjay96 thank you so much. Definitely proud of the like clear fishbowl effect I got on this one 😍
This is so adorable 😍😍😍😍

@itosh2go yeah but when I've never seen it before
@itosh2go do u have to walk over to them at a specific time?
@spaghettituesday19 nah I guess it's just a random thing after saving the reverent. That's one of the best things of red dead. You can play it x times, but you will always find something new 😅

I follow him lol still tryna get a double tap on a locker for a clip
That’s how I do mine every time! Gotta maximize the stun time on these nerds!
Nice one haha

This seems like the High-Q Double Tap as it converts a 3 second stun into a 5 second stun giving more distance after the memes. 😂

Rush Of Blood is the only one I played that didn’t set off any motion sickness! It’s fun but I never played much.
Here they lie, Impatient, Arizona Sunshine 😁
@nintendeez is Arizona Sunrise scary or just a zombie shooter? I’ve not seen too much of it.
@bubblegumisblue I really want to play Rush of blood, when I first saw about it I thought it was just a horror rollercoaster simulator so didn’t bother with it. It does seem cool though.
@retro_licker probably not as scary as the others, little bit jumpscarey. None of them are amazing tbh
Hahahahaha
I don’t know any other ones
But I’m looking forward to the next vid!
@nintendeez VR is still so primitive in the grand scheme of things, I know it’s cool any everything but I think it still has a way to come.
@lealeaa83 Thanks😊 I’m glad you’re looking forward to the next one.
@retro_licker I hope its supported well for a few more years. Astro Bot, Blood & Truth, Beat Saber... some amazing games
@nintendeez I am quite excited to play Beat Saber and Tetris Effect. Astro Bot looks awesome and I’ve heard Blood and Truth is also good.
I agree witch You great VR game 🔥
@retro_licker tetris is amazing, best xmas 2018 present I got by far 😁
Let us know how Rush of Blood is! Until Dawn was great but if all you do is ride a ride on that one, meh...
@wearegamergirls_ I believe it’s an on the rails experience so you don’t actually walk around but you are given weapons to fight the monsters and stuff. I’ll give it a go soon!
👏 VR 😍😍
As someone who beat RE7 in VR, then did it again by beating the game in 2 hours 23 minutes 50 seconds. I recommend RE7, it's amazing!
@aggretsuko_meme I absolutely loved RE7 and I only played the intro in VR, I’m no speed runner though, I wish I could complete it super fast!
I LOVE U SO MUCH I HUST WOKE UP

Tom Nook is so awesome
@hans.da.goof ACKCHUALLY they’re his nephews I think
@loogiebean ok then he gotta feed his family 🤧
@hans.da.goof bless you
@loogiebean thx fam
Non Tom Nook Fans: HE LOVES MONEY SO MUCH THAT I CANT KEEP TRACK HOW MUCH IM LOOSING

Tom Nook Fans: Boi, there’s an optional, he’s a really busy man unlike you, Villager
I never got it either(only got on the bandwagon for memes sake). I was more angry at Redd in City Folk, because I kept getting scammed
@vampire_countess - @plstclove ; they’re adorable and it suits them perfectly!! thanks for sharing!!! :D
@sure_bet_its_sherbet redd is so sketchy but u can google redds art guide to see which artworks are real or fake
@ulovejenna Yeah he is, unfortunately when I first got City Folk, I was really little and it was my gateway into more gaming. I didn’t realize that there were guides on the Internet until much much later😓

That’s a video coming from a guy who already had a Switch.
Fuck the lite
Get a switch lite if you want to play switch games but you have neither money nor friends otherwise get an actual switch
Yo angelo 🗿
@its.literal.lucifer no it drifts
@anthony298washington get better controllers then
@its.literal.lucifer by getting a entire new switch lite??
@anthony298washington if you have a switch lite and the controls break what do you do then
@its.literal.lucifer send it to game stop for a warranty
@its.literal.lucifer cause I had a warranty
@anthony298washington that only lasts so long though
@its.literal.lucifer your the one that said get better controllers
@anthony298washington yeah cus you were saying switch controllers have drift
Selling my switch for a lite because I don't use my dock at all, and I have miniscule hands so the smaller joycons seems like it'd better for me. Plus if I sell my switch for 250 I have 50 bucks to spend on other things, like not a switch. Also my switch battery dies too quick and if I buy the newer model then I'm - 50 bucks.
I'm still buying it someday idgaf
@johnny.cool.kid yeah but switch lite has a shorter battery
Spend 50$ more and get a normal switch
Yay!!!! Awesome 👏🥳
Does that mean no more games from limitedrun games being available at your store?

@myquih thanks I take it as an insult
@joey.jo.jo.junior.shabadoo you just need a pedicure to be your usual dorbz self
@myquih I just did 6 months ago
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
COOL!! 🙌
@that_buff_gamer Thank you gaymer!
@lololacre 😘😘
You can play Sonic using your feet?
I like this shot☺️
Do they do the 8bitdo in the pal button colour set? Seriously want one for the dpad alone
Beautiful clean pic, love it! 😍
@just_be_the_nerd not sure what you mean. This is the classic Game Boy colorway. Anyways, I highly recommend their controllers!
@handfulofgames the super nes has coloured buttons for the pal and japanese regions. Looks really cool
@just_be_the_nerd ah! I’ve never had a SNES myself so I wasn’t aware of any differences 😁 This particular controller is only available in US SNES colors then, I think. But they have other models with more colorways too.
@nintendream thank you! ☺️💕
Cute shot! 💖
@lepicgoose thank you!! ☺️
8bitdo ROCKT BABY 🤘😊
Tea is everything! 🙌😂 enjoy a bit of relaxing 😊 I'm currently playing a link to the past 😊
@megakalli89 absolut! 😊
@press_a_to_continue_ it is! 😄 thank you. I think the colder months are perfect for fantasy games like Zelda. But to me, winter is the definitive fantasy season ☺️
Freaking beautiful!! The orange tones in the first one are so eye catching and the second one looking so dark, dry and earthy! Also that creepy face again! So good
@scionjay96 did you notice the face in the first one?? 😁😁 It's subtle but once you catch it it looks like she's blowing the ash through the air 😄
@scionjay96 but yesss. The orange tones. And the best part between that contrast you noted is it's literally the exact same shot, just one faces the sky and one faces the rock wall 😁😁
@gamergirlshots omg really? I never would have known cause they are so vastly different. Just like our co-op day shots right there!
@scionjay96 omg yessss. Exactly like that
😂
Bruh I feel you, I’m sitting on a 1.5b Bank and I’m like I need more 😂😂😂

Back in the old days we'd party once the cash stack started to show letters behind the numbers. If you saw green, you were a God.

@tomwhore58 don't feel sad, I still considered it a power move
@grimy.ranarr hahaha well you’re just flat out a good man/woman. ❤️
@tomwhore58 fuck the h'ween masks it was all about that blue phat
100k itself was a lot for me ffs
I would cry if my bank is 10mil, thats my junk tab
I remember spending my bank doing monkey madness cause my small child brain couldn’t figure out the slider puzzle lol.
Yellow phat was 3m, chopped yews for weeks to get one lol, was f2p

Beautiful pic... everything will be allright. You have to believe in yourself
Yup, I agree with @huygheyasmine. You have to believe in yourself. And don’t have a kid just to make up for a broken childhood that you experienced. I personally know someone who did this & it is not going well.
@hazel_astute you re both smart and beautiful🙌🙌
Yeah.... totally teammates
Why don’t they have a blueberry emoji?
It’s be hurtful when your on the winning team for me
Sometimes........ it be like this. Other times....... it don’t.
It's always on the other teams, never been on me lmao luckily
Imagine this happens to you right as you join a match
@willrussell_yeet that's outrageous
That only happens to me when it’s a 6stack with meta weapons lol
Crazy one

What Uniqlo stores have Sonic? We didn’t see any in London.
@jazzylovesgames see a previous post of mine for the ones they have now
They look like they may have been the “fan submitted” designs.
How could they miss the iconic stripe on his shoes?
I live in AUS and had that shirt on the left
That adventure shirt is 🔥

@xenomu اللوت بوكس بيشمل اشياء تأثر باللعب زي الاسلحة
@ll04k يدهم تحكهم
@n_alsafari بالضبط 👌🏼
@9.ox3 بيكون فيه اسلحة حسب التقارير للاسف
@english._.teacher لا 😂
@ufxfz اذا من الستور لازم تكلم دعم بلايستيشن اتوقع
@itsamjd اقرا الخبر 👍🏼
@yp__54 والله صحيح
@imustplay قرأته، لكن ما فهمت سبب إستيائهم
ما اتوقع هذا السبب الرئيسي في سبب اكبر ان طور سبيشل اوبس حصري حق بلايستيشن لمدة سنة كاملة !
@dex115_63  بلاك اوبس ٤ عذاب كل ساعتين سلاح في البكجات😂
@mood.ar  ماتفرق اهم شي انت ايش تحب وإيش تكتيكك  وكل شخص وحسب لعبه اللي ايمه كويس غالبا ماياخذ الفاير ريت اسرع ع حسب ترا والافضليه دايم تكون بالفاير ريت (مجربها)
صناديق الغنيمه شيء غريب بصراحه، لكن طور special ops هذي بحق والله
صناديق الغنيمه  شنو 🤔🤔
ابللع😂😂😂
والله يستاهلون ايش اللي حصرية لمدة سنة 😡
نهاية الجشع حقهم ذا الشيء ما راح ينفعهم قالو ب بلاك اوبس ٤ مافي micro transaction و اضافوه قالو ذا الجزء ما فيه و الحين راح يكون موجود و سلامات طور كامل حصري لفترة شيء طبيعي اي شخص راح يزعل و يلغي الطلب
🥀
اخبر انهم قايلين مافيها ذالنظام
@imustplay انا اكس بوكس والغيت
دايما كود من زباله الى ازبل وما يتوبون من صناديق المزبله هذي ؟
الحين يارب ينزلون Mw2
@_7md_95  مالها اي دخل pay to win  كل انسان بدايته باللعبه بيحط عينه ع سلاح ويجلد فيه وحتى لو بعد عنه مردك له مثل m4a1 عرفته بباتل فيلد٣ ودايم العب به وACR ب mw2-3
اني لغيت الطلب من الاكس بوكس  ولكن رديت طلبتو بالبلايستيشن
@mrdestroyerr انت كأنك تقول ليه في العاب حصريه..كيف راح تتفوق شركه عن شركه اذ مافيه هل شي..يعني كل شركه لها قوه في شي بلاستيشن حصريات الخ اكس بوكس خدمات..ممكن تقول كلامك ماله شغل بس صدقني له اكثر من علاقه لأنه متصل بلحصريات الي هي قوة بلاستيشن بهل جيل
احسن و مفروض مايخلون طور الثالث حصري لسوني ترا في النهايه سعرها في جميع المنصات نفس الشي
دائما ، اذا حبيت توصل رساله لشركات نشر الالعاب ، استخدم فلوسك ، لانها اللغه الوحيدة الي يفهمونها ، اما الاحتجاج و التقارير الاعلاميه و ها الكلام ما لها تاثير عندهم دام ان اللعبه تبيع 😅
@abadedfgg ترا حتى لو ما حطوا الصناديق وقت اطلاق اللعبه،  مصيرهم يرجعونها نفس الجزء السابق 😅
@xenomu طور كامل حصري لسوني عشان كذا الناس زعلانين
يستاهلو على الأقل الأسلحة للجميع و باقي الأشياء سوي الي يعجبكم
@john_1z شونة الحجي
@prince_of_darkness_90 عندك في اسلحة تكون op
اما صار كذا بروح الغي طلبي اجل
@mood.ar لا ياشيخ والله موضوع يزعل
طيب ليه الاشاعات يكلاب حقققوددييين ياخي والله انفنتي وارد ما يبون شيء  بعدوا ي اكتجفن بعدوا
لا ما اتوقع
@xenomu طيب مين الحمار الي بيطلب اللعبه ويلغي الطلب عشان صندوق؟
@ghostx.gamerx زعلوا القيمرز 😔
@battlefield.arb مبسوط ها 😂
@vv.eru اذا انت اكس بوكس اي
يبوي مكبرين الموضوع مرا انتو انا كود اذا عجبتني اوكي مو مشكلة ايش دخلني انا باللوت بوكس يعني في ناس تدفع وفي ناس لا وبس عن نفسي الجزء ذا عجبني هذا رأيي
@surmaroute.h صناديق تفتحهم وتجيب أغراض منهم المشكلة انه غالبا الحظ خايس وفوقها الأسلحة الجديدة تكون موجودة فيه وبي
بستاهلو
@darksonic_2050 بس*
كفو
سنة ؟؟ بروح الغي الطلب على كذا
@xenomu  فيه داخلهم اساحة
@xenomu اسلحة *
@bdbd.v8 هنا صارت سالفة مو حلوة
كفو عليهم
مرجلللله الناس والله 👌🏼👌🏼🔥🔥🔥
@xenomu اي نفس السالفة بتصير مع لعبتهم الجاية
@ll04k قبله في بلاك اوبس  اربعه قالو طول فتره الزمن حقت اللعبه ما راح نحط مايكرو ترانز اكشن وشوفت عينك على قولتهم
@c4.xx ركز بكلامك الله يصلحك ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه
اححح 😂😂
@c4.xx الي يسمع كلامك يقول طور القصة تراه طور واحد وفيه كثير غيره
ما أتوقع عشان الطور اتوقع عشان صناديق واحسن عشان ما يحطونها يا اخي خلوها زي اوفر واتش أشياء زينة ما تأثر وشوف كم جابت اوفر واتش مليار
@mrdestroyerr  في عقد شراكة بين اكتفجن او تبن سوني كان علىdlcواشياء حصريا تنزل لبليستيشن بعدين للاكسبوكس  ول حاسب بهذا جزء dlc فعطوهم سبشل اوبس حصريا  للسوني مابيدهم هذا عقد بين شركتين لازم يكون في شي حصري
يالله بالبركة 🤣🔥
مايتوبون 😁
انا ماعندي الا بلاي ستيشن ٤ بس والله حركتهم وصخخخه ياخي عط اللاعبين كلهم الاطوار ولا تميز احد عن احد خل الجميع يستمتع واصلا اغبياء لو خلو الطور للجميع بيكسرون بقية الشركات بس الطمع ماكل قلوبهم
😂😂😂 افاااا شو صاير شو فاتني
@c4.xx قبل شوي تقول دافع ٦٠ والحين م تظن انك تشتريها -̈⃝؟
@5ccd  اقرأ كلامي زين
يستاهلو صراحة
@mulhamx4 يعني نشتري اللعبة بسعر كامل و تجي ناقص و فوق هذا ضايفين صناديق الغنيمة
@omanixbox احسن
@c4.xx قريته
@c4.xx كيف مافهمت ناقصه طور ؟
@mulhamx4 كيف ناقص وشهو الي ناقص
@mulhamx4 😂👌
@119.14v طور حصري لسوني
ياخي هم قالو ان الجزء هذا مارح يكون فيه مايكرو ترانز اكشن ليش يحطون صناديق وبكجات وماعرف شنو
اغبى قرار
@surmaroute.h تقريبا مثل صناديق الحظ اللي في اوفرواتش
@5ccd  اجل البلا بعقلك مو بكلامي
@119.14v  السوني لهم طور حصري لمده سنه
@gamingwave1 اللعبه بتكون كل اضافتها مجانيه وواضح متعوب عاللعبه واكيد ميزانيتها عاليه وايد ف طبيعي انهم يضيفون زينه عشان يغطون عالتكلفه ويحسنون اللعبه اكثر واكثر وردة فعلهم مالها داعي الصراحه
@rn.97  صناديق فيها اسلحة يعني pay to win
احتكار
هذلا حمير ما يتعلموا من اخطاءهم ف الاخير بيعلنوا افلاسهم وبطلع واحد غبي منهم يقول سوينا كل شي لارضاء الجميع بس ما نعرف ليش فلسنا
كيف الغي الطلب؟
@oisainly من حقك والله 😞
مايتعلموا من أخطاءهم 🤦🏼‍♂️
احسن والله لو انه نظام يطلعلك تلبيسات ما عندي مشكله اما افتح بكج علشان اسلحه هنا مشكله
حمد الله
😂💔
كفوووو 🔥
الصناديق مالها داعي 
والحصريه سنه عباطه المفروض شهر مثل كل الاضافات
😂😂😂😂
@9.ox3 هو قالو انه زينه اصلن ، بس اتوقع اللاعبين خلاص ما يبون الشركات تطمع و اي لعبه جديده تنزل ينزل فيها صناديق
😂😂
كفووو
@omanixbox وابويه 🤣🤣
@00o0i  شهر و كثير لانو ناس دفعت  نفس ثمن يعني كلهم عندهم نفس النسخة مو عدل وحد يلعبها اليوم و واحد يلعبها بعد شهر و كلنا دافعين عليها ستين دولار
وش سالفة الصناديق و ليش عصبوا عليهم؟
الحمدالله ماني من ربع كود وباتل
@ryan_almohimeed ترا الشركه قالت انه مابيكون فيه اسلحة
اكتفجين في موضوع البكيجات ما تتوب لازم تجيب العيد او يسيطر عليها الطمع
نظام البكجات والملابس اشوفه جيد 
لكن كنسلتً اشتري اللعبه لانها مو كامله ليش انا ادفع ٦٠ دولار واللعبه ناقصه طور !؟؟يااصير زي البلايستيشن او بلاش من لعبتكم بالحالتين اللعبه ابو ريالين ماضنتي بشتريها اصلاً
احسن يستاهلون فكونا من نظامكم الزفت الي كذا
@oisainly معليش فصلت
احح .. انا منهم اليوم ألغيت الطلب 😂😂
احسننننن...عشان يسترجلون هم و EA
احسن
مفهمت؟ شسالفة؟
😂😭
احسن 😂
اوفر لكم بلس بأسعار جميله 🔥❤️
اللعبه حلوه بس لو يخلون محتوى الصناديق زينه بس يكون احسن

Su TW3 ho passato le prime ora a girare tutta la mappa, ricordo quando ho visto per la prima volta il demonio e lo spirito della foresta, io tipo livello 1 con armi di merda e non mi restava che...CORRI RUTILIA CORRI!😂
Stessa cosa con Zelda
È vero 😂😂 e non lo faccio neanche apposta
Tranne con days gone, le montagne sono segnate mappe inesplorate, solo che le montagne non sono esplorabili
Anche dove il corpo fisicamente non ci può arrivare comuque è in qualunque modo bisogna scoprirlo
Beh con la modalità fotocamera è tutto più facile
Parole sante
Vero mi da fastidio sto fatto! Deve essere tutto al 100%
Sarai un vero esploratore quando, come me, avrai completato al 100% la mappa di sacred 1.
Non solo quello😂😂😂 Specialmente Tomb Rider.
Che poi c'è una differenza tra esplorare la mappa e stare nei posti più remoti a camperare
Uguale in The last of us
Fidatevi che con the last of us 2 lo spolpo fino al midollo
Come dimenticare le ore su " X men legends l'era di apocalisse 2 " a esplorare ogni singolo angolo in cerca delle missioni secondarie e dei pezzi d'armatura di iron Man. Ah che bei tempi
Basterebbe rendere necessario giocare le "missioni secondarie" in modo plausibile ai fini della trama del gioco...😒
Mai. Nemmeno sniper elite.

Yeah it’s not the best way to live :/
@possiblybutnotreallyaubrey  It’s actually because of a physical illness I have. I’m in pain 24/7 and have no choice but to stay inside because if I do go out and I end up in pain I have to go home ASAP before it becomes unbearable so I can never go more then a 20 minute walk from my home.
@glowingtaurusss oh no I wasn't coming at you, it was just like "haha having the mental ability to make yourself do things other than sit around must be nice". It was meant to be a joke.
@glowingtaurusss but looking over what you said I misread the post, I apologize for that
@possiblybutnotreallyaubrey it’s okay , I was just a little confused aha x

Ah dude 😕 What’s up with your Switch?
@terror1979 It warped dude. So it's bent. Gonna guess it's from overheating. It's no longer under warranty either, so I'm dreading what Nintendo are gonna charge me 😂
@nintendocam Good to hear your nephew got his sorted with ease. Thanks for the positivity man! 😄👍
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies Thanks man and no worries! 😉👍
Ah dude that sucks! Hope it’s fixed soon, in hear there are issues with the Lite too now!

That's a bummer. Hope its fixed soon ❤️
@terror1979 That's true. Thanks dude 😄👍
@fierytsunsora Thank you 😉👍
Nooo least you still have the DX version to play

Nooooooo
That sucks. I've been having right joycon disconnect issues, might have to do the same 🙁
Oh man! That sounds devastating! Hope it gets back to you in no time!
@woody2610 I was surprised at how well it went haha it was maybe 2 weeks which was mostly it being in transit back and forth haha works perfectly now!
I'm sorry to hear that your switch is now under repairs, I hope they'll get it fixed right away, but at least you have other systems to keep you happy, like that gameboy of yours, that's good yes?
Damn that really sucks dude I hope you will get it back soon
Ah man! Hope you get it back quick! 🙏🙏
Here’s to a safe and speedy recovery 🙏🎮
Nooooooooooo I had to send my nephews back to get fixed a few months ago... it was really easy and fast for us, hope the same for you!!! 😁

@carlonovara08  questo e  @iacopo_nicelli se non La smette di smanettarsi
almeno avendo un pc da gaming qualcosa si può fare
@alessiocuneo
I più esperti giocano anche con una sola mano
Mi è successo purtroppo
F
Il mio incubo peggiore
@brando.dg come in demon slayer
@gabriele.romano_ con la bocca
@federicorosatii la triste storia di @andrea_nove9
F
Io con il braccio rotto scomposto ci sono riuscito
@nick.stirpe tu che farest😂
@sofiacervonii ammezzerei il dottore
io mi ero rotto il polso manriuscivo a giocare 😂😂
Capita troppo spesso
@fabiomeli_exc ma cosa cazzo ci parli a fare con uno che spara queste sentenze🤣🤣🤣 tempo perso
@raulcostantino alla games week era già in difficoltà
@leo_poli04 manual br(uh)eathing
@guarnacciasebastiano quel tipo di persone li solitamente conosce bene una certa mia Khalifa
@_lorenzo_pisanelli commento sottovalutato
@lo_sai_chi_sono_ no, ma spostare il mouse e cliccare col sinistro è una puttanata pure senza le braccia
@leo_poli04 ti odio pezzo di merda 😭
F
Nooooooo😭
@meryo89 maledetto
@mattia.marasco_  Chernobyl
Ok ma chi lo mantiene il telefono se una mano è fasciata e con l'altra mantiene il Joystick?
@sofia__rebecca preferisco le loli piatte e da galera
Mi sono commosso😢
Mi hanno intrappolato in un orgia
Mobile "Gaming" has joined the chat
@cagnin.a noi ne sappiamo qualcosa
Per ogni fratello un infame
@mortebianca0000 sai cosa fare
@gabriele.romano_ fa male qui🖐🏻, qui 🧠,ma soprattutto, qui❤️
@chiarax_cirix ma poi con che cosa registrava haha
Siamo tutti con te..
Brutta storia.
@wikipedia_dei_commenti è lui coglione? Ma che ne sai tu se quello si è rotto il braccio cadendo come una minchia oppure l'hanno investito sul marciapiede? Giusto per fare un esempio, io boh...
E quel giorno mi chiamarono per giocare la world cup...
@matteogaroli @danny_settembrini @mure91 @christian_coli_ 
Hahahahah
Bhe può giocare da PC Ah no... bhe puoi giocare da mobile ah no...
Meno male che non ho mai avuto un braccio rotto ahah
@fabiomeli_exc per fare un video e scrivere maledetti dottori. Anzi dovresti ringraziarli
@wikipedia_dei_commenti maledetti dottori l ha scritto la pagina... Non il ragazzo che ha fatto il video
@viber_nm @demix_07 che storia triste 😭
Brutta situazione mi ci sono trovato anche io 😢
😢
@coli_andrea_ povero 😅😂
😢😢
@mure91 Hahahah
@coli_andrea_ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
vabbè giochi in octopus
Noi ridiamo e scherziamo,ma quanto è straziante non poter arrivare bene a left/right?
@rayan121203 ormai siamo immuni
ho giocato per un mese con l'indice perchè avevo il pollice bloccato
Mi dispiace so che è dura😂
@er_golem il mouse lo muovi col culo?
@leo_poli04 che cos’è?
@francescosozzi_
Ecco perché preferirei rompermi una gamba @about_rita._ @chiarax_cirix @emanuelepiodiguglielmo
Ciao a tutti!🔥 Siamo una nuova Page riguardante i Videogiochi. Metteremo Memes e Curiosità (e altre rubriche che ci consiglierete voi). Ci piacerebbe molto se leggeste il nostro primo Post, dove spieghiamo tutto quanto e vi prego di commentare con un "Io ci sono" per farci sapere che ci sosterrete anche in futuro. Non vi costa nulla, solo qualche minuto...❣️ Grazie in anticipo per chi lo farà!😘

io ci sono riuscito anche con il gesso... NON MI AVRETE MAI LURIDI DOTTORI INFAMI 😂😂🔥🔥
@audrile_vle zitta zoccola
Son gli stessi che ammettono che il video gaming sia una dipendenza
@sofia__rebecca crepa pure
@_lorenzo_pisanelli ha fatto bene dottore
@dade.leone
@sofia__rebecca non ci sono foto cogliona
@alessandrozecchi ahahah😂
Un minuto di silenzio
Il vero dolore...
@audrile_vle @polizia.dei.commenti qua abbiamo un problema
Ma con quale mano registrava?
sad
@_marco._.torre_ vabbuo ma tu sei tu
@leo_poli04 l'ho trovato così tante volte che adesso respiro manualmente pure mentre dormo, ho raggiunto un livello superiore
Respirazione manuale attiva
Controller xbox adaptive e via
Cazzo c'entrano i dottori? È lui coglione che si è fatto male al braccio....
@leo_poli04 non funziona con me, non so perché
Può comunque giocare a getting over it con la sinistra
F
Io con il gesso sulla mano destra ci giocavo comunque per la disperazione🤣🤣
Io giocavo pure cn il gesso
Vabbè hai l'altra mano, fatti le seghe
e le seghe?
Canzone?
@savethecocomero TUUUU
Figli di puttana ora per vendicarmi li fascio il braccio con delle mele e vediamo poi
Mi viene l'ansia
Sono il dottore, lui camperava
Ed è qui che si cade nel mobile gaming😂

Ti seguiró quando inizierai a portare giochi di calcio seri tipo FIFA 20 dove un cristiano ronaldo se sei fortunato di esce ad agosto.
@donistifler ti darò retta quando capirai che un gioco sensato di calcio è un gioco dove una partita somiglia ad una partita di calcio reale
@capaflix bhe allora ti sfido a giocarci al 20...c’è una differenza abissale con il 19.
@donistifler ancora troppo poco rispetto a Pes. Comunque ci vediamo a dicembre. Vengo a fare i miei oro 2 con Belotti prima punta come l'anno scorso.
Meglio Zarate @capaflix
@xisco_8704 meglio Iturbe
Sul secondo cristiano, na bomboletta d'ossigeno sarebbe tornata comoda 😂❤️

A essere bello e bello ma fa schifo Sorry lo dovevo dire
cristo, - 150° ma stiamo scherzando? uno dei gradi più freddi mai registrati è stato di, - 172°, ma in un posto lontanissimo dal sole in buio perenne, ipotermia istantanea
💙
@thecervbest c'è chi pensa lo stesso di te 😇
@cosadici_daniele è pokémon, mica superquark
@lp25_link eh quindi ho espresso un parere e quindi per me fa schifo come Pokémon per squadra e tu non puoi giudicarmi dicendo che faccio schifo
@pokemonlegacy.italia
@thecervbest c'è modo e modo per farlo
Vogliamo parlare del suo verso?
Comunque le altezze sono sempre state ridicole. Mia zia è alta quasi come quel brontosauro
@lp25_link sono un gran appassionato del no sense pokemon, probabile che farò così sotto OGNI post
@cosadici_daniele ok però si scrive nonsense
@lp25_link bhe ognuno sceglie come dirlo, io preferisco così
@cosadici_daniele ehm no
@cosadici_daniele vogliamo parlare di Macgargo? Non solo è più caldo di due soli, ma immagina la temperatura scaturita quando esce dalla pokéball
@andrea_foscari.2 25.0000 gradi, quando il sole (fotosfera) rasenta i 12.000 e i 12.500
@cosadici_daniele era quello che intendevo, lol
@andrea_foscari.2 Macgargo usa ondacalda a 200 di BP costantemente, come Aurorus echeggiavoce
@andrea_foscari.2 lo scioglimento della calotta polare, ora sappiamo a chi dare la colpa
@cosadici_daniele @gretathunberg fa causa a The Pokémon Company
❤️
Aurorus è bellissimo, è uno dei miei fossili preferiti!
Ha il miglior verso che abbiano mai fatto per un Pokémon
@samu_franz ma Kricketune?...

@wnapictures I heard about that! Didn’t remember to check it out yet though. But am going too!
@showmerealzelda I guess she appears only when there's a foggy weather around 9 pm to 3 am and everytime you visit her, her story changes. Sometimes she's appear but the other times you can only hear her voice. It's cool and creepy at the same time!

Lovely sunset view! 💙
@firewraith_screenshots thank you!
I love this cover. 😍. Its such a fantastic game too. Yes, I believe the next Horizon will be PS5. Will definitely pick that one up for sure.
HZD defo needs a sequel on the PS5 man, absolutely love that game. That Ghosts of Tsushima looks breathtakingly good aswell doesn’t it!! The way God of War ended is wide open for a huge PS5 follow up too.
Love these cover artworks. So many great games open for sequels as mentioned, ghost of tsushima looks incredible and I would love to see GoW and HZD both get sequels. It also looks like naughty dog have a new IP in the making as a spin off multiplayer of TLOU factions. Beyond that, who knows?? Another game from quantic dream would be awesome too
From what I've seen, Ghost of Tsushima is my #1 right now. It looks right up my street 😍 and man, that game looked fucking beautiful. I'm getting kind of bored of all these sequels though. I'd like to see companies doing something new !
I would love to see Socom as a true tactical shooter again.
The has to be HZD in next gen I’d also like to see the Spider-Man squeal on next gem that would look incredible
Oh hell yeah. I would love a new Horizon game. Loved that.
Yep HZD definitely.. maybe GOW or detroit 😊
PS5 Horizon is going to look so good. I’d like a new Ratchet and Clank and Spider-Man
Nice shot man you have a unique style, maybe soon I will play that game next week if ai get my ps4
I would love to get sequels from our beloved games but also new topics and stories. Personally I think upcoming games like Cyberpunk 2077 could set the tone for some new gen games *fingers crossed*
Perfect shot my man! Love these covers, So sad that we can't have them here! I would pay to have an Uncharted 5 and Hzd 2!
Great😊
Fantastic shot of a fantastic game. Those covers are really awesome. Got to try and get my hands on a few of them. Some sequels of course but I'd love a lot of new amazing IPs.
I'll be extremely surprised if Ghost if Tsushima gets a PS4 release. I was actually starting to think that TLOU2 was gonna be PS5 too 😂
Faz tempo
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aw shit!
Definitely one of my top favorite games.
😍
Yesssss😍
I still love it!
I think that was better play with normal pad than "analog controller". i hate using analogue on resident evil. 🙋
@dopegaming91 fuck ya dude the birth of THE EVIL!!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻💀
I didn't like the Dual Shock edition of Director's Cut as I liked the original japanese version from 1996 (I have both versions in my PlayStation games library). The Dual Shock edition sucks on soundtrack which, in my opinion, don't sound as good as the 1996 original (and even the non-Dual Shock edition from September 1997). The japanese versions of Resident Evil have all the censored scenes uncut (specially the intro scene, where Joseph, from Alpha Team, is bitten until death by the zombie Doberman dog) and the German version have all the uncut scenes in color. Luckily, due to works of many game hackers (visit some stuff at ROM Hacking), it's possible to patch the game to have a much better experience (Even better then the original japanese version from 1996!). But, no doubt "Resident Evil" REmains a unforgettable package 😃😊☺️
@k_pax_05 Me too. A lot of times when I try to run, the analog controller don't point Jill or Chris on the direction I want them to move 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️
@erikmolykote1984 definitly True. Very complicated to move on.
@erikmolykote1984 Dude I've seen the uncut version of the opening cutscene. It's so much cooler. I definitely agree with you!!!

↪Для меня Assassin’s Creed 3 — одна из любимых игр серии. Конечно, в ней хватает и минусов, но мне даже не хочется о них говорить — почти все они так или иначе присутствуют в каждой части франшизы и не относятся к третьей напрямую. Порт на Switch вышел просто отличным — игра радует приятной картинкой в портативном режиме и действительно хорошо оптимизирована. По крайней мере по моим ощущениям, она идет даже плавнее, чем версия для Xbox 360, которую я когда-то проходил дважды. Ремастер Assassin’s Creed 3 определенно заслуживает внимания на какой бы платформе вы не играли.
⠀
📌Финальная оценка: 8.2 из 10

@gerundiy117 и сколько же стоила эта кредо Ассасинов?
@shakenov7 в целом, не очень дорого 😁 Так же, как в свое время я брал его на Xbox 360)
@gerundiy117 тогда всё отлично! Вообще, я итак не буду покупать свитч.
@shakenov7 по причине финансов? Или личная неприязнь?)

@nikkip830 trendsetters is my personal favorite, I enjoy the graphics of it 💗
@thiccpokebois always a great choice!! I also love Trendsetters because you can make mannequins and design clothes for GUYS!! They need fashion love too, I wish they would bring it back and not in a separate store like Styling Star. >.>

Haha dude? You think you're cool, you think you'd beat me in a 1v1? Dude, I spend all my time in creative mode practicing my 90s and my editing on my iPad screen, and I do truly think I'm underrated. I've been grinding for Chronic #FearChronic because I know one day my grind will pay off. I've been playing since the first day and own every skin in the game, including Recon Expert. You think you're good, but I bet you don't even own Renegade Raider. I still remember when there was no tilted towers, I'm a true OG player and I'm sorry kiddo, you stand no chance in a 1v1 against me and OG skin thumbnails and my habit of listening to outdated "OG days" rap while I play. Get out of my game nerd, before I clap you. I play on mobile, I would appreciate a sub, you can be an OG fan of mine today.
@synexy yet your clips don’t prove that🤯🤯
I checked ur content and i really liked it! We are av family. The cutest  fortnite family on ig! Use #avfontop  so our members will seee them too! Honestly i want you as our new recruit myself

Ogrywalem kiedyś i tytuł dla mnie był szalenie nudny i powtarzalny ale może coś się w tym temacie zmieniło 🤔
@mateusz.papis Trzeba mieć napewno team by tego funu było więcej. Zapraszam do mnie :-) Tak, wiele się zmieniło. Nowe tryby, itemy, skille. Jest nawet mayhem, gdzie wszyscy się leja na wszystkich na jednej mapie. Wyobraź sobie co tam się musi dziać :-D warto wrócić do tego tytułu. Ja napewno w środę odpalam Striker’a
Yeah but I still cant find games without connection fucking me tho
@zack.a.reeeee on PS4? Hmm, I didn’t have many problems when I played it. Gonna check it out tomorrow and see how’s matchmaking
@graveyard_of_games Xbox, disconnects whenever me or friends try to find a game
@zack.a.reeeee that is odd, maybe one of you guys have problems with your NAT settings. I’ve had similar issue in Halo games
@zack.a.reeeee Try setting your router to Nat2

@jeroen_kop I'm a beginner myself but I have the will to conquer this game. You can't be the master without first been the learner.
@petri.hooli hahaha...you are truly the last ninja 😎😂
Can you play it completely offline?
@trusteft there's solo play mode if you don't want other players in your game but the galaxy is same.
@petri.hooli But do you have to be online (internet)?
@trusteft yes
@petri.hooli Thank you for your replies.

Not anymore after she cheated on mak Ora and she said horde is nothing saurfang is the real King 🔥👌🏼
@dorianlaubies i know i wrote it for the memes
@dorianlaubies bolvar is the guardian of the real lich king(nerzhul)
@btlkomtrikru She is the most fucked up character in wow and you still like her lol
@luizcarlos.12345 she is the most clever character in wow and yes i still love her now you can fuck off
@dorianlaubies His?
@evan.d.sonurus sorry but no. Ner'zhul coexisted with Arthas ... At the beginning only, then he killed him, killed his mind as well as the innocent version of himself.  Nerzul is definitely dead since this moment 🤷‍♂️
@the_machine_god "her".. sorry, I'm not english 😅
Вождь!
@the_machine_god he's not wrong, we all know female elves are guys IRL
Long may she lives

For sylvanas! >:v💖
No! She’s doesn’t rule anything! It’s all about her— she left her own people! I hate her so much! And I play Alliance.
from the horde to for the porn, the step is short.
Woohoo!!!
@somacruz82 lol dude that’s why we like her cause she doesn’t give a fuck
@somacruz82 offcourse is a queen.. she rules the.death
@somacruz82 she rules me and i'm pretty sure about it

Ich könnt mir vorstellen das es ein Reinfall wird 🤷‍♂️
Sieht nicht so dolle aus 🤷‍♀️😫
@das_rothaar  dein Kommentar genau, richtiger reinfall🤣🤣🤣🤣
@gun_dula0 dein Kommentar genau😂😂
@freddys.98 na ich pass mich halt an...
@das_rothaar an einem bild sowas festmachen, ist echt hanbüchen
@freddys.98 bist du der erste" offizielle Super Nintendo World Ultra"??
@das_rothaar nein, aber ich bin find sowas egal wo bei wem lächerlich, an einem  bild, wo ein kleiner teil von etwas ganzen zu sehen ist , schon alles festzumachen . Lächerlich lauchi
@freddys.98 ich hab ja auch nicht gesagt das es schlecht wird sondern das ich mir das vorstellen könnte und das liegt ehr darn das mit denn spass von einem Nintendo spiele für mich  schwierig in ein Park bringen kann außer das es halt danach aussieht und es  Attraktionen gibt die den namen von sachen tragen aber ich kann mich auch komplett irren...
@das_rothaar  ich sach ma so, du musst ja wenn das komplette artwort sehen , was alles geplant ist, da reicht dieses bild bei weiten micht aus , da es ja ein ganzer themenbereich werden soll😍😍

@edizyurdusevimli kfkakfkakgksskd
@electro.claw nøkk da gayet guzel oynamasini bilene
@yagizeren01 yinede kötü silahlae ile kalmamış karakter copy paste
@electro.claw ozellikleri biraz benzetmeden 100 operatöre ulasamazlar özellikler biraz benzeyecek ama yine de bence bu benzeme güzel ne tam cav gibi ne tam vigil gibi bir de atakta bence bu özellik benzemesi gayet güzel
Aga çok doğru echo main <3
@electro.claw kötü silahlar da tabancası ve pompalisi baya iyi sadece fmg - 9 biraz geri kalıyor fakat fmg - 9 da biraz underrated diye düşünüyorum aslında recoili gayet kolay bir silah onun dışında istatistikleri de çok fena değil
@yagizeren01 yinede kötü bu olay evet haklısın 100 karaktere anca öyle ulaşırlar. ama silahlar copy olursa 2 3 sezona kalmaz oyun biter
@electro.claw Avusturalya ayisi mi iyi cidden?

Montre nous ta collection 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Je l'ai trouvé comme le 1, et c'est pas un compliment 😂
Sympa mais déçu aussi.. Je voulais le platiné mais les 2 derniers trophées sont trop chiant à faire (éclater les ballons et les drones)
Ah tiens, j'avais hésité a le prendre ce collector... Mais la tête avait l'air pas ouf du tout en y regardant de "plus pres"...
@mokato.95 😂😂
@khaoskollektion ah moi j’ai même pas pensé à la platiner 😂
@melandriatheonlyone alors la tête c’est n’importe quoi 😂 mais elle m’a tellement fait rire ! Je l’avais allumée et à chaque fois que je passe devant il commençait à chanter ou me demander un câlin ou un bisou 🤣
@lameduse2.0 bah de base je la voulait pour ça, parce que ca avait l'air fun, mais quand, en video, j'ai vu la gueule des finitions et la qualité du plastique qui a l'air bien crade (mais pas dans le bon sens), je me suis dit que c'était pas la peine, dommage, je l'attendais a mort pourtant tellement j'avais adoré le premier...
@melandriatheonlyone oui c’est pas hyper bien fait mais c’est tellement nul et drôle 😂
Le genre de déco que je rêve d'avoir 😅
@antonio.vilar.9843 😂
Perso j'avais adoré le premier mais je n'est pas encore acheter celui la ^^
Creepy AF 😁😁😁💙💙💙💙
Hey I main MK
This whole time!!
Wow :0
Totally agree. Every once in a whole I’ll come back to it even tho i know all the puzzles. I just really like the dialogue 😄
Definitely.
Monkey Island 2 is the best story but I do love the art style in 3.
Agreed 💯👌
I dare disagree. While the story and dialogues were remarkable, the graphical style didn't appeal to me at all. I honestly prefer MI1 and MI2 to this one. Besides, if it wasn't for a story that falls behind the rest, I'd even rate MI4 higher than MI3. Still, every single Monkey Island game is a good choice regardless of all the drawbacks. It's just a matter of preference within a nevertheless strong series.
The 3th is the 3th better. 1 and 2 are far superior
@rkvear I too think 1&2 are superior but mainly because I grew up playing them. I didn’t get round to 3 til about 10 years ago.
MI 1 & 2 are iconic, but I can understand someone ranking MI 3 ahead of them.  Each game definitely brings something unique to the series.  I’m actually playing through MI3 right now!
Agreed 💯👌
Agreed 💯👌
Curse of Monkey Island is my favourite out of the series. I love everything about the game :) the artwork is awesome, the music is amazing and the story is brilliant.
When i first saw the art style i realy not liked it. But after playing it i loved it. For me the best Monkey Island game.
Assolutamente no! Come contenuti e come grafica MI1 e MI2 non hanno rivali.
Awesome ghost love story. Monkey 3 is awesome, but in my opinion the 2nd part it's better.
The Curse of Monkey Island was the first of the Monkey Island games I played. That leads me - right after Toonstruck - to the adventure games ❤️
Open the bed
Ugh! 😍 ❤️ LOVE Curse of Monkey 🐵 🌴 island!!! MASTERPIECE of all graphic adventure creative disciplines! Every time I see anything from this game I still get chills. It is that good.
And I am loving my own post because I love it that much! 🌴
👍
Curse is the best
Piango 😭😭😭❤️
Di sicuro questi sono stati i migliori giorni della mia vita, mi sono divertito tantissimo insieme a tutti voi. Vi Amo... Spero che ci rivedremo molto presto ❤️😭
😍😍
Io diciamo che tra me e il mgw c’è stata una sfiga, il primo anno jd era già uscito, nel 2016 non ho potuto, 2017 ci sono andato ma non ci sono stato molto perchè avevo un bimbo rompipalle con me, nel 2018 c’è stato uno che non voleva, e nel 2019 ho avuto questo imprevisto, spero che te la sei goduta da Dio, perchè il mgw è un’esperienza unica ;)
Ci vediamo probabilmente l’anno prossimo, 
Giaco
Grazie di tuttoooo ❤️❤️

I've put off buying it until I catch up on a few other games, but I'm really looking forward to this one!
Same here, would like to buy it, but there are too many games that I still need to finish 😅
@pferff yeah I was going to wait but my friend was selling it so I got it cheaper 😂
@meestergeek I know that feeling😂
Yep. It's an amazing game.
Haven't picked this up since it didn't really catch my attention.. But i hear a lot of good things about it so i might look in to it 😁
🙌Great post🔥 Keep Grinding and don’t stop😍 Maybe Can you drop me a follow that’s all I ask❤️ Keep it up🙌

@fortheloveoflucasarts it's an interactive narrative storytelling genre based on choices. You can use three different characters, and each character has a specific story. It's really Interesting and it's not boring at all
@silahplays gonna definitely play it! You should post more :) like seeing what you have to say plus post yourself sometime
@fortheloveoflucasarts i will definitely post more, thank you! :) But I don't think I'm gonna post myself, i find it useless. I just like to show my passion genuinely 😊💖 I think I'm gonna post some playthrough tho, it could be useful hopefully

First,you guys have to fix all the problems after the update.I lost my weekend without playing elite because I couldn't access the mission board!!!Almost 3 years playing elite,this never happened to me!!!!I'm very disappointed and frustrated.Instead of growing and getting better,this is not what I'm seeing here.
I'm starting to fear alot of this is too big to fix. The screen tearing on my XB1S makes the game borderline unplayable as it ruins immersion entirely
Yeah to be honest I probably wouldn't be doing any "livestreams" or showing face until the issues are resolved... Otherwise it makes the developers look like they don't give a $#&@ and are distracted by irrelevant crap like voice acting, things that would be exciting for a game in Alpha/Beta phase... Not 4 years after release. Lol...
Hey Elite Dangerous Team. Langsam ist es echt peinlich mit euren Updates. Weihnachten 2018 Update eine Katastrophe. Nun das September-Update ... genau so eine Katastrophe. Da macht man große Ankündigungen für neue Spieler, die kaufen das Spiel und können nichts groß machen. Das ist bestimmt nicht gut für euer Image. Fly safe ... Cmdr Aldedaran. 🇩🇪

@_segasaturnsnk_ @crabbit_gamer I would love to know who TF picks the games on these, three World Heroes games?  Are you FING kidding me?!?!? AOF 2 instead of 3 and why no KOF 2003??? And dump Samurai III and KOF '97 while you're at it. Here's something.....isn't King of the Monsters technically a fighting game?  Why isn't that one here!!! One the plus side - this controller/stick looks a billion times nicer than that Capcom surfboard monstrosity...🤣🤣🤣
@retroescape hahahahha, true! If I had the capcom one id mount it to the wall
@crabbit_gamer that thing is gonna be huge, and I bet there's not enough space for two players to play comfortably, shoulder to shoulder.
@crabbit_gamer BTW the basic version of this stick is $130 US.
@retroescape it's an eyesore, why the hell wouldn't they try to emulate the actual neogeo control panel from the arcade
@crabbit_gamer they'll save that for when they release the limited edition version!  Hahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣
@crabbit_gamer Mount it like a boar's Head.
@retroescape exactly
Pass. This will be pure trash.
@cee_dub_gee If the HDMI out is on par with or better than the Genesis mini I'll pickup the basic version of this.  Not gonna hold my breath 😂😂😂

@snokokwak The circle of HATE
@christian_sisco FAXXX
@yahirisswag I see a lot of it on both sides. Everyone blames Everyone dude
@lordleo idk. Could be your tanks fault for not creating space
@juniper___ same
@snokokwak heals don't blame tank they blame dps
Me for every time I play sigma
But like fr fr if the tank had gold dmg, the do’s really slackin
@d_.ren heals blame everyone and they are right
@juniper___ do you play on PC?
@lorenzokkkkkk hey don't dps shoot the entire game? doesn't the entire cast of overwatch shoot the entire game?
When DSP are ineffective it's up to tanks and healers to carry the game. Fact.
Oof this is me
I never point out having gold kills or dmg unless to close pals to show off Lmao but it is annoying being the only one doing damage and securing kills as a tank while everyone else refuses to push 😭
As a Zarya main, i take loads of damage to build charge and block my dps from damage
I blame myself whole heartedly for the teams fuck up, cause I suck :)
The using barrier for the team is kinda inaccurate, since the barrier isnt made to be a main shield. Its made more for a defense matrix kind of use, where you flick it up and down to block ana nades/other important abilities, not neccesarily to shield the team
They be thankful to healers though. 💝
*Moira
I’ll blame my team for feeding if there is nothing more I can be doing in that fight to keep them alive
@notyourderpina exactly
@ewaifuu me when i was 11
But sometime the dps just suck, they blame the healers  and tanks but they push by themselves and don’t work with team
@noxrib
@briksi_ 😂
That basically me lmao
Except I use a barrier
Dps pls delete
@lorenzokkkkkk was the name of the player something like "Jand0t"? xD
But sometime the dps just suck, they blame the healers  and tanks but they push by themselves and don’t work with team
If our dps aren't clapping enemy cheeks then they are fucking throwing.
Tank blame dps, dps blame heals, heals blame tank, tank blame dps...
I’ve had tanks before that run in, charge and swing their hammer constantly, never shield. “I have gold dmg?!” Of course you do more damage, you have a larger health pool which you’re feeding to dps. Your dps are squishy and die instantly of course you have gold damage. Lol
@juniper___  I play support so 🍿
Inaccurate
@lordschmombey @lorenzokkkkkk Ok? But is she wrong a shit ton of dps in game can out damage orisa she has literally every right to say that if you or your other dps dont have it then why can she not say that?
Moira mains more like
Ughhhh
Role queue is retarded
Literally last game for me
But if I’m playing Rein and swing my hammer max 3 times and one fire strike every push. Focusing on protecting my team. And still manage to have gold medals. Then my complaints are valid.
i hate the peephole who say they have gold elims like NO ONE CARESSSSS 😭😭
@pirate.ay wir
Bro i've seen a orisa say "Why do I have gold damage??" BECAUSE ALL YOU DO IS JUST SHOOT THE INTIRE GAME IF YOU DIDNT HAD THEN IT WOULD BE BAD
Legit one of the biggesy role q problems are tanks since they dont adapt to the meta, play two off tanks, or tanks that dont synergize , or one tanks wants to play with what the tanks need the other just picks rein in a bunker compisition.
@poifix more u hit more elims. I’ve always found the tanks should have good elims for simple reason if they should be hitting shit and pressuring shit more then dps. Especially currently, where assassin heroes like reaper and doom are dominating, because they look for entry points and aren’t constantly shooting shit.
If i play dva, i AM the gold medal
Tbh, I sometimes say these (my main is sigma for now) when I get gold elim AND IT'S JUST 5 OR LESS. Wtf are you doing dps 😩 And it sucks when I've put the barrier on, tell the team to group up, but they would go anywhere they like 😩 And of course, blame the tank after losing, like what am I supposed to do??? Split my self into 6? 🤣
Annoying doesn’t mean incorrect
Ok but shouldn't the dps in reality be the ones with gold damage and Elims. After all they are the DAMAGE characters. Why do the tanks gotta have it? I'm a dps main I always have it because I know what I'm doing. As tank I still get it and I'm not that aggressive.
Please do a mercy version

@plutonr777 un mio amico che vive in Florida, era oltraggiato del loro aumento dal 8.5 al 9% delle tasse. Quando gli ho detto che noi paghiamo il 22% non poteva crederci! 😅
* prossimamente al 25%

La password per il sangue e le fatality per MORTAL KOMBAT sul MD è A-B-A-C-A-B-B. 😂
@grazia.arena.1253 dipende da quello che vuoi, io le tutte e 2. Ma io sono malato e collezionista quindi non faccio testo :-)! La lite è comoda se viaggi spesso, pesa poco, è compatta ma non si può attaccare alla tv. Cmq se dovessi suggerire un modello direi la normale, non la lite
@tommasoingiappone grazie mille! Penso proprio che seguirò il tuo consiglio!
Perché prendere una switch lite se hai già una normale?
@tommasoingiappone  cos ě il tower?
@doctorgameofficial  doc cos ě? quel tower?
@enrylosb perchè pesa meno quando viaggio e poi perchè... Hai visto il mio video sulle console? Guardalo capirai :-)
@tommasoingiappone vado subito 😍
E la variante giapponese del MD mini ha i joypad a 6 tasti...
@martinocorli 😍😍😍
@danielepachinko un pezzo di plastica per malati come me
@plutonr777 ed il bello è che aumenterà pure fino ad arrivare al 25%...
@tommasoingiappone ě da inserire sul md. Ma non ha nessuna funzione se non di abbellimento quindi?. Bellissimo ❤️
@danielepachinko esatto
@sabrinada79 grazie al ca... Loro pagano scuola (tanto) sanità (tantissimo) e non hanno la pensione... Tutte cose che noi diamo molto per  scontate...
Ciao Tommaso, cosa cambia tra il MD mini ufficiale SEGA e quello su licenza uscito un paio di anni fa? Io ho quest'ultimo e ne sono abbastanza deluso. In pratica il processore zoomma la grafica originale (in bassa risoluzione) in HD rendendo i pixels enormi effetto Minecraft, orribile. Molto meglio il MD originale collegato con la scart. Dai video sembrerebbe che il Mini ufficiale non dovrebbe fare questa porcata ma nel dubbio evito di spendere soldi per un altro bidone. Grazie
Io la amo switch lite❤️❤️
Da noi non esce il tower mini 😭😭😭
dall'8 al 10...ma in giappone lo sanno che in italia l'iva è al 22?
Fino al 23% c’è ancora tempo 😂
Ho letto su Twitter che molti giapponesi sono preoccupati per questo aumento al 10% , molti hanno fatto acquisti e io mi sono fatto tante risate pensando,  che ne sanno loro del nostro 22%🤣🤣🤣🇮🇹
@plutonr777 sono così :-)
Ciao Tommaso ti seguo sempre con enorme piacere ed è un piacere ascoltarti e la tua Yuri davvero dolce! Mi piacerebbe sapere il tuo parere tra la Nintendo Switch e la Switch Lite sono intenzionata a comprare la Nintendo Switch ma non so quale prendere tra i due...Sono più propensa per la Nintendo Switch non lite però mi piacerebbe sapere il tuo parere/consiglio..
Neanche la rockstar farebbe una foto così bella

IM NOT READY FOR IT
Dina will turn out to be a half human half infected monster who'll betray Ellie and then somehow Ellie will lose her immunity and bite Joel, then Thomas will come in and shoot the hell out of everyone. End of story. I'm sorry I ruined it for you guys🤗
My fan theory has kinda spiraled out of control... Ive felt dina is going to betray Ellie the moment I saw her, but after the last trailer I'm fairly sure the person they kill in the trailer is Joel but in game they're going to show it as the Asian guy who's killed. (ellie mentally can't handle it being Joel killed so blocks it) and the joel in game you play with is actually just going to be a figment of her imagination that is only revealed when she meets her mother for the first time.
I’m sure Joel will die, it’ll be GoT the longest night all over again if all the main characters survive, don’t get me wrong I like Joel but in the interest of telling a good story I think a big character has to die and it certainly isn’t going to be Ellie.
The group Ellie been hunting is the last remaining fireflies, who are trying to hunt down the murderer or their leader. After ellie finds out Joel's the reason Dina was killed she has to choose revenge or forgiveness

Its like ENCE all over again

@riley_kline10 they just saying eg did a good pickup
@riley_kline10 they just saying eg did a good pickup
@juliusk_ how so?
@rentnercs it seems like eg strats are made just to defeat astralis, or i'd say "ANTI-ASTRALIS STRATS"...Surely it won't be the same had liquid reached finals against eg, liquid is a team that is on par with astralis looking through their styles, but the difference though is the execution

@mackobarron hahhaah😂
@simmo________ I'm sure EG payed them a lot of money so they'll be right
@nazzl.e Better have been like millions
@nazzl.e 3mill
EG BEST OF ALL TIME UNDEFEATED 8 YEARS EZ CLAP
💰💰💰
If they keep being succesful everybody will start stealing their strats just like it happened to Astralis
@pr02xy owners of the team
👍👍👍
Eg most toxic team ever
@mattey_88 I meant we are talkin bout investment here not team or players. Just imagine if EG paid NRG like 200k $ for NRG's Cs team and they just played under the EG name and won 100k, so that's half of there money back in few days. Plus sponser money etc they get like 130k total so they'll spilt among payers fir there salaries and then the rest for the org so ez investment
@100thievesgaming this could be you but you clowning

I napoletani già avevano previsto tutto
@_di._.no_ a napoli non mettiamo il casco poiché tanto tempo fa se mettevi il casco ti sparavano perché pensavano che tu spacciavi o cose del genere allo è rimasta sta cosa (ora non ti sparano più 🤣) ma non perché è pesante.
@sofy.amatooo vabbe penso si capiva che ero ironico ahahahah

@toeknees.spam more custom operators? Really?
@maverick_so_happy i love this idea of custom ops a while back me and my friends did something similar and it was so much fun to think of counters n etc i think it's cool and is definitely enjoy more
@toeknees.spam well shit thanks man, I’ll try come up with some more, just annoying there isn’t a template for this kind of thing lol
@maverick_so_happy try making everything you need super small and then enlarging
@toeknees.spam will do, if you liked this though I’ve got another custom operator I made a while back, and ubi did actually end up making something pretty damm similar
@maverick_so_happy who.
@toeknees.spam House, might have to go down through my shitty memes to find him though lol
@toeknees.spam House, might have to go down through my shitty memes to find him though lol

@r.4mi 😍😍😍😍😍
@iinclz
@loyrx بلايستيشن ٥ بتنزل نهاية السنة الجديدة يعني تقريبا بعد سنة كاملة فذي عبارة فرصة للي  ٤ يبغى يشتري بلايستيشن
@ammar_am21 وطبعا يحلل ابوها😂
@ammar_am21 ما اتوقع فيه ناس ناويين يأخذون بلايستيشن الحين اللي ناوي يمدي ياخذه،النسخ ذي للمعرقين و يحبون التجميع
عمره ماتكلم لعبه فاشله ماراح اخذها لو يصيح
@loyrx باقي سنه تقريباً
@x3z2q يسس
@loyrx بيع سوني ٤ حقك و جمع فلوس سوني ٥ و اشترلك بيسي
@x3z2q عندي بي سي اصلا بس ناقصوو كرت شاشه
@r.4mi انا اتوقع باخذها لانه ما عندي وحدة واخطط العب death stranding فاحس بستفيد منها
@ammar_am21 اذا اليد تباع منفصله ليش لا بس اشك بهالشيء
@loyrx بس اول ماينزل محد راح يشتريه لين يقل سعره
@c1wv 😐
@r.4mi ما اتوقع يبغون فلوس هم كذي ما احد بيشتري الجهاز😂😂😂😂😂😂
مووجود طلب مسبق على الايدي السعودي ؟؟؟
اصلا خلاص ما بقي شي للبلايستيشن 5
يالله  كوجيما ذا ناوي يحرقلنا اللعبة كلها
ما القى اليد لحالها طيب
@orabellaplays مافي خبر اذا بيبيعونها بشكل منفصل او لا
@alexey_kozhemyaka ооооооо ну все понятно, ты эмо короче
@kkkonovalll ты рофлишь или аутист я уже понять не могу...
@alexey_kozhemyaka ты хочешь сказать в Бога не веришь, все ясно
@kkkonovalll обосрался в чате - коси под дурачка, хорошая тактика 👍
Люди которые думают что фаны Астралис оправдывают свою любимую команду, нет, мы понимаем и видели что ЕГ сильнее сейчас и мы не спорим, но вот в чем мы уверены так это в том что зал помогал ЕГ
@alexey_kozhemyaka это не оправдания для неоднократных чемпионов мира
@dudnikruslan прочитай мой отдельный коммент, мне лень еще раз писать
проебал - не ной
как всегда в кривых руках, виноват зритель ахах)
Не умеет проигрывать))
В жопу Астралис! Я так рад что они проиграли)
Я не их фанат, но по факту правду говорит,это не нормально, естественно эмоции заставляют на это указывать.
@alexey_kozhemyaka о ну да глор астралис, ты блять жизнью видимо обоссаный если ты за них топишь
@r4skol если не смотрел стрим, то пизду закрой.
Best sprayer
Да он не хочеть видеть другую команду чемпионом так нельзя епт
@kkkonovalll нихуя че выдал, хейтер астралис иди отседова, тут все за красивый кс, сильверочек наш)
@priistensky а тебе хуйню не пиздеть
Voce esta certo. E muito triste msm. Voces sao os melhores👏👏👏
А сами гранату кидали если зрители выкрикавалт то они перетягивались
жеңілгеннің сөзі құрсын сігілш
@g.tuliubekov ты представляешь какая там у них аппаратура и кабинки, думаешь что они слышат что то
@g.tuliubekov а астралис проебали без шансов, только на трейне была борьба, и теперь пытаются вину за победу, перекинуть на фанатов
@g.tuliubekov им по кд кричали все мейджоры, всевозможные баги с радаром юзали, и как игру перевернули против них «очень разочарован в зрителях».. не было бы зрителя, у него бы не было такой зарплаты, а у турнира таких призовых. Надо уметь проигрывать, а не говорить что проиграл из-за неё, из-за него, или кого-то ещё)
@kkkonovalll кабинки аж никакие
@kkkonovalll раунд на экономику на инферно зал подсказал, честно это?
@alexey_kozhemyaka а да блять, именно зал конечно же, астралис же не проигруют
Ну да ситуация не приятная
@kkkonovalll але, ты там хейтер успокоишься? Я про тот раунд когда глейв мансил, а зал тупо подсказал кому-то там куда глейв пошел, это честно?
@alexey_kozhemyaka да я хейтер бластралис, ну во первых такие моменты е
@kkkonovalll кабинок не было, игроки слышали зал, так что харош бомбить и хейтить, а прими факт что зал помогал ЕГ
@alexey_kozhemyaka случаются часто а ноют только они, во вторых тебе то откуда знать чем они тогда руководствовались, в этом раунде
@alexey_kozhemyaka именно да 16:3 проебать из-за зала 👍
@kkkonovalll ну наверное потому что чел из ЕГ хотел идти на А но толпа заорала и он остался и убил
@kkkonovalll ноют это первый раз высказать недовольство? Что с тобой не так?
@kkkonovalll я про один из раундов на экономику, я не спорю что ЕГ сильнее
@alexey_kozhemyaka слушай ты если ты хочешь выйти со мной раз на раз так и  скажи я ведь такой красивый, если что позвонишь мне, 0968513478
@alexey_kozhemyaka и не надо
@kkkonovalll че ты несешь? Сколько тебе лет? Раз на раз? Ты ебанутый?
Нужно научиться проигрывать, вот и все
@priistensky все по делу сказал,  не мало таких моментов в финале видел
Credit for the art goes to @shencomix , honestly one of the best comics on the internet I love that dude
Opposite for me, cant get used to DS1 pace
jokes on you ds3 is just as fast as ds1 when it only runs with 15fps
I don't blame you, transitioning from the combat in DS1 to DS3 (which you can see the obvious Bloodborne influence in the flow of combat) is pretty hard imo
Skipped DS2? Good choice.
@abysswalker116 what you think I'd miss the chance to fight both a red AND blue smelter Demon? Get out of here
@panagiotispapado1924 I treat it like chess more than anything now, patience is vital and I love it all the more for being so distinct
@crabmannington don't forget about solo & double Dragonrider(s) or Alva and her clones
@abysswalker116 Dark Souls 2 isn't even the second Dark Souls, there's just a minimum of 2 of every boss
@crabmannington can't wait for Dark Souls 2 II, then with 4 of every Boss
I just kick all these games asses now 🤷‍♂️ Ds1, 2, 3, Bloodborne. Only thing I cant do in Ds3 is reliably parry but I'm a parry God in Bloodborne.
@psylence95 I get through them rightly, probably better than a good few people but a healthy struggle never hurt anyone lmao. Parrying in Bloodborne is the most satisfying shit out there ngl
@crabmannington especially when your riposte one shots everything. You go from hunting danger to becoming danger 😂
@ertu420 lifehacks
Ds1 is the best
I feel like the whole world of Bloodborne moves slower than DS1 I don’t know why.
I feel this
@crabmannington like the 3 asylum demons are any better 😂😂😂
@hjbassguitar nah that's totally understandable it's a big asylum got to keep the staffing levels up 😂

@nutsonbacon right? Looks a bit auto aim ish
@rebel_chubb lol nah I’m just saying he’s good
Hack🤦‍♂️
@4li___pubg keep playing with the phone😂
How about aim but? People are not idiot and they can see and they can realize!😓😓😓😓😓
@mr.lekrin but you are hacking
@atony_357 still here ?? If you think I'm a hacker, why are you still in my videos?
@mr.lekrin cause your hacking bullshit keeps showing up on my feed
@atony_357 You can always block me, although honestly it lifts my spirits when they think I use hacks😂😂👍
Bro idk how you play on pc I played on pc got my ass kicked😂😂
And @mr.lekrin if he was using hacks he wouldn’t need to aim😁
@mikesnipesbfv1 pc is full of tryhards, but battlefield 4 doesn't work well for me, I receive 1 frame kill 80% of the time really .. even if they use a pistol, I die from one shot.. :(
Have you unlocked the AWS? That thing is pretty much the same as the ace 23 but with a 100rnd drummag
@emielv_17 have to try that! Is it assault or support class?
@mr.lekrin support
@mr.lekrin it is a really easy assignment. You should be able to get it within a few hours

@kawaquinn Na dann.....einmal Zero Suit Samus bitte 😍! 🦄
@gamer_with_mask 😂😂 mal schauen ....sie hat ne viel bessere Figur als ich 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Wipe the floor with Boba Fett" Yesss -- thank you for saying what we were all thinking! 😋
@kawaquinn Pffff das ist doch völlig egal 🦄!
Samus Aran for sure! She’s kick-ass and then some. 
My favourite Metroid is Fusion or Zero Mission. I didn’t play Super Metroid until after those two and as ground breaking as it was those two are more polished. That being said Super Metroid is a great game. 
As for the 3DS iteration I haven’t played it yet but I suspect I will like it as its predecessor for the GB was what got me into the series.
@greenachingthumbs Yeah I played Super Metroid after I played Metroid Prime 😂! Which is still my favorite game in the series.
@gamer_with_mask 🤔maybe I should give Prime a shot. I’ve owned it since forever but I’ve barely scratched the surface.
@greenachingthumbs Oh Boy It's an amazing game. Second one was kind of a letdown but the third one was also pretty dope!

"U m m m m, Chiaki? that's a Nintendo 3DS-" Said Hajime, making an rather concerned face while pointing his finger at the 'Nintendo Switch' she's using.
@zukiechi  gets shock and look at her nintendo 3DS " o-oops? I didn't mean to say nintendo  switch " ;)
"What a gamer.."
Fortunello!

Being the aggressor 💪🏻 good stuff!
@jixxtv Wir haben aktuell 2 Stück im Shop, das hier sind fast fertige Entwürfe - Sneak Peak sozusagen! Sollten heut Abend fertig gestellt und dann auch für euch verfügbar sein! 😍
Coole Idee, brauche noch was für die Wand hinter meinem Monitor 😏🥳
@rspwnd bin gespannt, die werden sicher Mega!!!
Ich hab viele Regale und Vitrinen, dableibt kaum noch Platz für Poster 😅😂.
@jixxtv THX 🙏
@frau.trallafitti Dafür ists ja genau das richtige 😉👌
Hab auch eher Poster 😍👍
Da ich 'ne Dachbodenwohnung habe, wird's mit den Poster ein bisschen schwierig und Poster an einer Dachschrägen sieht einfach doof aus! 😅
Kommen noch ein paar Regale für die funkos , aber es sind noch genügend Wände für Poster und ich auf der Suche nach den passenden. 😅
Wir machen das Gaming Zimmer ja komplett neu in der neuen Wohnung. Poster und Regale natürlich  aber bloß Keine Funkos 🚫🚫🚫
@somethiinglittle Hehe irgendwie sind Funkos ein ziemlicher Knackpunkt hier 😄 aber dann wäre doch sicher noch Platz für eins unserer neuen Poster 😉👌
@der_robi Das stimmt - aber einfach Regale dran hängen kann auch schief gehen (im wahrsten Sinne lol)
@timmiiis.gamingecke AHA! Dann bleib gespannt was wir noch releasen in dem Bereich! 😉
@rspwnd 😎wird gemacht !
@rspwnd Oh ja! 😂
@rspwnd noch sind die Wände alle leer 😜
Ahh. Habt ihr das Poster vorne gar nicht mehr im Shop? Gerade gesehen und verliebt. Aber nicht auffindbar 😔
nvm @rspwnd gerade oben in einem anderen Kommentar gelesen. 🔥🔥🔥
Beides würde ich sagen 😅
@xrockzii Hat ja doch noch geklappt 😉👌
Hab ein funko zimmer 😌
@nerdxinked 😄😄😄👌
Die Teile sind ja mal mega 😍 gibts die schon im Shop, hab sie noch nicht gefunden!? 🙈 Geile Seite 😁👍🏼

@havok_lk это не кадр из будущего проекта, а лишь рисунок стилизированный под мультфильм, он не имеет ничего общего с Нетфликс. Откуда такие поспешные выводы?)
@witcher_tales ну в общем было сказано, я видел что указан бы автор сего арта.

Subscribe for Subscribe? DM me your YouTube channel link✓
😂😂
That's literally my entire career of throwing stuns haha
Does anyone else think he looks like Klay Thompson here? Lol
Is the game worth getting at all? The only thing that interested me was the punisher actor being introduced to the game!
@darren_24_1994 If you like looter shooters. Yes! This game reminds me of a mix of the division and wild lands of you played either of those. It also has a feel of destiny with the player hub. The story I really liked and got into it and that’s why I kept playing! It ran like meh on my pc though xD I’d probably wait till it goes on sale though. I wouldn’t go spend €60 on it
@legend_of_shan all the comparisons you mentioned I’ve just heard from a YouTube video I was watching.😂 fair enough thank you! on top of Christmas I need to be considerate on what I spend 😂🤷‍♂️
Honestly I’m dying to get the new cod 😂 but then again I do this every year to myself 😂😂😂 @darren_24_1994
@legend_of_shan funny enough I was going to ask you about COD 😂 I played the beta but it just felt like it’s another cod 🤷‍♂️ didn’t see anything impressive 🤷‍♂️
@darren_24_1994 I haven’t even played the beta kinda annoyed I didn’t 😂
@legend_of_shan but the game and let me know what it’s like.😂✌🏻
I meant buy 😂😂
@darren_24_1994 only reason I am cause cross platform and I’ll have friends to play it with 😂
@legend_of_shan yeah I think the cross play was a brilliant idea and intriguing! we’ll have to play together!
@darren_24_1994 yes! I’m on pc now mostly! PS4 is only for the last of us 2 🤤🤤
@legend_of_shan I’m buying the ps4 for the last of us 2! 😂 I’m super excited for it I don’t mind PC (i know there’s that fan base where you have to loyal to only one😂) I would play PC if I had the room! or if I still had my original pc
u cute couple :3

@geeky_diana I only ever buy men's more comfy and well women's clothes are just not to my tastes. Girls like deadpool too you know and comics and star wars
@press.start.to.continue I ended up not making it 😂 Elin wanted Cheddar cookies with her tomato soup so I'm going to make the pie somewhere this week😊 I will keep you posted 😉

Happy Playstation merch Monday :)
@heart0fhadrian it is!! It's a men's sweatshirt but xs fit thankfully😊
@thebobaman4 they didn't have the hoodie unfortunately 😥 a white sweatshirt isn't the greatest idea as a mum (already got some jam stains 😂🤦🏻‍♀️).
@real_dave_brown thank you!! 😊❤️
@ratolagamer thank you so much 😊❤️
@nerdxinked it's really comfy 😊
@geeky_diana oh no way. That is my worry too. 🙈
@cns0_0g ze hadden bij onze primark alleen deze. Wit is alleen niet zo een goed idee met kleine kinderen 😂😬. Ga van het weekend even bij een andere kijken.
@_thefoxgirl_ 😊❤️
@lealeaa83 me too!! Although wearing white with small children wasn't my greatest idea 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
@littleaimeekins it's so comfy!!! It's men's but I fit xs so you should too!!❤️
@xeneriith thank you 😊❤️
That jacket looks super comfy
Havent got round to wearing my white jumper yet. Got my ps hoodie on today though. 😍. Certainly know the feeling of messy rooms 😂
Love the jumper😍 have a great week yourself

This game will scare the hell out of you. I'm not easily scared and this game almost have me a panic attack.
@retrojunkie Well, that sounds good for someone who's easily scared 😅😁
Oh I had no idea it was a prequel of Until Dawn! Why would they make it VR only 😖
@bubblegumisblue Yeah, it's a shame it's now available for everyone ☹️
I can’t believe I enjoyed this game more than I did playing Man of Medan😂
It's a prequel to Until Dawn? Whaaaaaat!? I had no idea! 😨 But ... but I don't have VR 😭
I saw you playing Moss and was going to ask. When are you planning to play Inpatient? 😃
@me_ushi You're so harsh, haha, love it 😂💚
@_gnasty.gnorc_ Yeah, it is, about 60 years before the game, interested to see, what happened 😱
@gamerpliskin8 Next weekend probably, also gonna try platinum Moss 😊
The inpatient is an amazing experience as my #1 favorite game is until dawn
Astro bot is a must!!!! My favourite VR game!!!!
@greygrey1954.recpsvr Can't wait to try it 😊
@consolegamer84 Definitely! It's just so expensive so I'm still waiting to buy it 😊

What’s so significant about this wallbang
When you say we lost ash Acog like it's a bad thing, I fucking hate ash
@andrew.bercik it’s my only good ash clip when she had her acog
Hahahahaha this is brilliant! Man she is super tall!
@retro_licker the longest legs you could wish for, lol
This is brilliant. 😂 I love it.
Woah!  This is awesome  Look at how tall she is too! 😲

@buzzlightweight_ later then ?
@piers.brown_111 what are you currently running?
@frankiesbadger_gaming minecraft probably
@frankiesbadger_gaming I need to finish gears 5...... Shadowkeep tomorrow bro
@lanaaaaaaa_a everyone gotta start somewhere. It's taken me years to get my perfect build.
@frankiesbadger_gaming and probably a lot of cash trying out different parts 👍
I’ve spent a good 40 hours “researching” over the summer and slowly saving a few pounds here and there on parts
@piers.brown_111 what build are you going for?
@frankiesbadger_gaming due to cost and need for good cooling at the same time I made a couple of compromises but a Sapphire RX 590 Nitro + (the best 590), AMD Ryzen 5 2600, some very fancy RGB 3000MHz RAM 2x 8GB, 650W modular PSU, Bitfenix Whisper RGB fans, a custom AIO CPU cooler. MSI Carbon Pro B450 motherboard with Wifi
@frankiesbadger_gaming RX 590 > GTX 1060, it’s basically AMD’s version of a 1660 but looks nicer imop
@frankiesbadger_gaming oh yeah...going SSD only 500GB to start with
@piers.brown_111 you should have 2. Put your operating system on one and games on another.
@frankiesbadger_gaming I should probably do that.
On my current gaming laptop oddly enough OS and literally everything else has been automatically allocated to the SSD (500GB SSD, 500GB HDD)

En type Electrik j’ai un faible pour les Pokémons Dynavolt/Elecsprint et Lixy/Luxio/Luxray 😍
@geek_n_book très chien électrique tout ça !
Moi j’aime bien Voltali !
@eme_la_plume sûrement l’eveelition que j’aime le moins 😂
Moi je penche plutôt sur Pikachu et eleckable
J’adore Pharamp super Pokémon je trouve et la forme mega de type dragon niveau esthétique bof mais puissance pas mal
Sinon un tank type électrique Elekable sans hésitation
@bouledieb un classique et un original !
@kermit_dbz_ j’adore son esthétique moi!
@kermit_dbz_ je l’aime bien aussi!
Assez classique pour moi : voltali 💙 J'ai toujours un electrick dans mon équipe, je peux pas faire sans !
@rounarde ah moi j’en prend jamais 😂
En pokemon électrique je dirai Pharamp ou Lanturn *-*
@miyo_bianca_chan très deuxième génération tout ça !
Pharamp ou Luxray, je les avais dans mon équipe car je les trouvais top ^^
C’est justement mon pokemon favoris !
@anaaklusmos_ ah bah ça tombe bien!
@cyrielle_g_ je comprend !

It was one of my greatest finds back in the day too. I couldn't believe how good it was ... now I wanna play it again lol
I played this as a kid with my little brother so much nostalgia
Maybe I was too impatient as a kid and was too used to action games to appreciate this game but I remember enjoying the concept of it and the music was also relaxing.
Such an awesome game. Picked it up a few years ago at a thriftstore couldn't believe it. 😂

Pokemom, Ace Attorney and Jewel Pet (japanese game). The only Nintendo console I owned was the first Game Boy and the rest I just use an emulator.
So adorable! Pokémon and animal crossing are my faves 😊💗
I remember getting mines years ago when the DS lite was the new thing and I loved it so much~ 😍
There’s so many good titles on DS, it’s hard to pick one! Gonna go with Final Fantasy III and Castlevania Portrait of Ruins!
Cute!! 😍💖💖💖
Animal Crossing Wild World, Dragon Quest V, Dragon Quest VI, and Dragon Quest IV, Dragon Quest IX, Rhapsody A Musical Adventure, Tamagotchi Corner Shop, Time Hollow, Professor Layton An the Curious Village, Professor Layton and Pandora's Box, Broken Sword, and Cooking Mama.

Finde diese Weisheit sehr weise 🙆‍♂️ ne im ernst, ich komme frühs so schlecht raus und da ich jetzt deinen kenne werde ich ihn mir jeden morgen vor Augen führen 😂 hab aber auch einen für dich. Nachts ist es kälter als draußen 😂👍
🙏Wem sagst du das. Komm gut in die neue Woche 😎
@hinkowicz Halt Ihn Dir vor die Augen und ich bitte um Berichterstattung!
Deinen Spruch kannte ich noch garnicht...den muss ich erstmal wirken lassen :D
@r3trogirl Komm Du auch gut in die Woche :)
@biomogs dank dir🤗
Ich liege seit 08:00 Uhr rum. 🙈 Werde jetzt aufstehen. 💜
Ohne Witz. Deine Weisheit hat mich angeregt viel nachzudenken. Ich meine "Wer nicht aufsteht bleibt liegen" ist erst einmal eine einfache Aussage. Aber da steckt so viel mehr drin. Wenn du vom Boden weg willst dann musst du aufstehen. Dich wieder aufrappeln, auch wenn du vielleicht lieber liegen bleiben würdest. Oder wenn du liegen bleibst, wie beispielsweise im Bett, dann grenzt du dich von jenen ab, die das möglicherweise nicht tun. Die Welt dreht sich weiter.
@nico_der.echte Deine Ansicht gefällt mir! Und es freut mich, dass ich dich zum nachdenken bringen konnte. ☺️
Gut das ich dich heute früh zu dem Spruch inspiriert habe 🤣weil ich lieben beleiben wollte 😥 Du schlauer Mann❤🌿
@ri_kuri Lieben und bleiben klingt gut! 🙈♥️
Ach, bin ich das? 👀🙈

That looks fake
Racism isn’t genetically embedded, it’s a product of environmental change. Yet Zahler refuses to stop his thematic world-building there. Guilt is another aspect to criminality that further cement these brooding fatigued characters into the darkened city that they reside in. The officers, in particular Ridegeman as opposed to the younger and less experienced Lurasetti, suffer with less guilt than the criminals themselves. It contrasts the morality of these individuals perfectly. White officers who have been fortunate in life, negating the descent into criminality. The actual expendable criminals of black ethnicity, struggling with daily routines whilst being taunted by the city’s underbelly, realising the danger they are putting themselves. Toying with regret. The brief appearance of Summer, another meaty role for Carpenter, acts as the device that incites the guilt. The morality. The ethicality. In a thrilling symphony shrouded in noir aesthetics that resemble the shadowed doubts cast in the minds of the characters. Cutthroat dialogue that cuts through even the thickest block of concrete. Dark humour embedded to further characterise the bonds of partnerships, particularly Ridgeman’s barrage of percentage likelihoods and Lurasetti’s “anchovies”. Elongated untouched scenes of conversations, food chewing and positional shootouts (that happens to be one of the most intense third acts this year). Perfect casting choices across the board. Gibson encapsulating his real-life persona and shenanigans to produce a worn down and gravelled officer. Vaughn elegantly providing a reminder, with his astute comedic timing, of an aspirational officer being held back by his partner, but remains devoted to the bond. Zahler’s minimalistic yet provocative directing techniques ooze confidence and illustrates the brutality of his meticulous crafted narrative, including the prosthetic violence.
•
Cont...
The ambitious range of styles during the car following segments were instantly captivating. The ingenious lighting and shrouding mist escalating the humidity of the crime that is slowly being played out. And yes, much like his other features, it is a slow-burner. The only problem with this, is that it really didn’t quantify its overextended runtime. Nearly three hours! By its conclusion, Zahler struggled to finalise the story by offering a handful of chances to abruptly satisfy the robbery. Yet, the further he descended, the softer the impact. A dire shame considering the intensity of its preceding events. A few various unfinished cuts between scenes and unprovoked time jumps which skews the pacing somewhat. However a minor editing criticism in what is Zahler’s best film to date. He understood the brutalism of his characters and world. He provoked the morality and ethicality of his story. And he irrefutably fulfilled his promise of showcasing that trademark violence. If being dragged across concrete is this tantalising, then sign me up to the next construction job and commence the dragging!

Once again we're very close to agreement. It really only is the last 30 minutes where I feel it could be tightened up a little. You really feel the confidence of Zahler though. It's almost like Nolan going from his early works to The Dark Knight. The scope and scale of the films took a massive leap and the confidence in what was going on screen jumped tenfold. I get the same feeling from Zahler with this film.
@gettodamoofies Honestly I was so bloody impressed with this, that a re-watch could easily up the rating. I agree. I wish he just eased off and tightened the conclusion. It kept going and going and going...! Still, best of the three without a doubt 👌
@gettodamoofies 100% agree. It was uncompromising until the very last section, where it felt like he suddenly realized and then put in different buffers to try to segue to that ending, but it had already hiccuped the tension and lost focus through the finish line a bit. Curious to see if that feels the same way on second viewing after knowing what to expect! 🤔
@rivergoth I suspect a second viewing may make the meandering ending even more obvious. It really is a shame, as I believe he could’ve ended it sufficiently without the “eleven months later...”!
@themoviediorama yes. The second watch cemented my opinion on the finale, though truth be told I didn't mind that part of the ending. I would've preferred the two preceding scenes have a touch more urgency to them. Then again, Zahler is methodical in his pacing, even if I don't agree with it.
Really good movie, one of my new favourite directors.
Definitely need to do a zahler day! Thanks for a great set of reviews
@thevideovault_ My pleasure! Thanks for reading them! 😇
I loved it!
This is been In Our watch list for so long
@popgoesthebeasle Agreed! 🙌

Phenomenal film
Glad you enjoyed it! I love Zahler! 3 out of 3 for me! Nice review!
Yeah, definitely too long, but still one of the year’s best for me
Well written review I'm starting to like Dragged just a tad bit more than Bone but it's a close tie.

Schifoso camperone
Saltare e andare a zig zag abbassando e alzandosi, imprecando ogni volta che ti fa soppressione
Respown 1...2...3

Ui calla calla.... Recientemente he estado jugando al Yakuza 0 y en los arcades ingame tienen versiones completas y jugables de super hang on, fantasy zone, out run y space harrier. Qué drama sacar 5 millones de puntos al puto hang on para el logrete! 😂
Sega siempre pionera en todo. Que recuerdos fundir el botón de turbo cuando se ponia a 284km/h en el súper hang-on

Miss these games😢.
You can always replay them as I do :) @overkobragaming
@sumayofficial good point 😁
Just know i finished playing AC brotherhood... Heading towards Revelations
I'm collecting all feathers in ac2
Have a good time! ❤️ @mrjaypanchal96
I assume you're done with main story by then. @s.k.2.6.3
@sumayofficial yeah, that was the first time I played it in 5 years. It was nice to play it again.
The graphics in the games before AC III make me laugh because the quality is so bad. 😂😂😂 Ezio was hotter in the trailers.
@s.k.2.6.3 those damn feathers take forever 😂
@keiththedefender men I still loved them nonetheless
I want to go back in time and get the good games like ac2 and ac. I honestly hate how spaced out the worlds are now and I absolutely hate the leveling up system.
@my_name_is_chey_but_im_not_shy That’s good for you?
@my_name_is_chey_but_im_not_shy 😂 I have 50
@mrjaypanchal96 Get some tissues ready! If you're as sensitive as I am, you'll end up a sobbing mess by the end of Revelations. XD
@blueangel1619 ohh 😅
@mrjaypanchal96 you'll understand once you reach the 3/4ths of the game. XD
@blueangel1619 man this ezio auditore is so badass....i really respect his dedication whatever he dis in brotherhood...All hail Ezio Auditore 🙌
@mrjaypanchal96 INSIEME PER LA VITTORIA!!

Juegazo, y de hecho ese es el que jugaba de pequeño, aun que solo tenia el cartucho. Fue uno de los juegos que herede de mis primos junto a la MegaDrive... que recuerdos❤️
muy bueno 👏 fue uno de los juegos que tuve de pequeño y le tengo mucho cariño y admiración 🔥🔝
Nunca lo jugué en Megadrive, lo tenía en snes.Mi juego de Disney favorito es el World of ilusion, fue de mis primeros juegos de la consola y le tengo mucho cariño 🔥🕹
Yo era mas del libro de la selva , en ese epoca elejias  y te quedabas sin el otro 🤣
@retronigga64 ya ves, la pasta no estaba en nuestro poder 😅
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies los de mickey también fueron muy decentes, el de snes y el de sega apenas presentaban diferencias, pude comprobarlo
@retrojuegazos yo tuve que llorar sangre para poder jugarlo así que te comprendo perfectamente 😂
@javialvi19 Y que lo digas! una pena porque los de disney aparte de ser chulisimos tienden a ser dificilillos y desquiciar a mas de uno🤣
@beat__86 ya ves, que afortunados fuimos por entonces, que pasada de juego
No olvidemos el gran Sonic & Knuckles... ❤️❤️
Vaya juegazo, yo nunca lo llegué a tener pero se lo rapiñeaba a mis primos jajajaja, aún recuerdo el sufrimiento del nivel de lava con Simba de mayor, horrible
@srbarher sisi suelo meterlo en el 3 implícitamente jajaja
@javi_san_san ya ves, saltando de un lado pra otro pra no quemarte, aunque odio mucho más el del puto avestruz 😂
On mega drive its better then on SMS 👍
Yo me compraría un MEGA 🤪 Mini .... PerO 😂 PARA PRENDERLE FUEGO 😂😂😂 QUE COSA ➕😭 MALA.... 😂
@sega_master_system Mini MegA is OnE 💕 ShiT 💩🤣🤣🕹️... In my 😂 MINIMEGA 267 GAMES... 45€
@taburoto para gustos colores es evidente, yo si me la pienso comprar 🤔

@geeky_diana oh, mint green... I need that in my life now haha
@cns0_0g Thanks! 😁
@thescarlettegamer go get it 😬 haha
@theloudnessofthegames Thanks 😁 imagine how they would look with a yellow one next to them
Oh, yellow would be cool! Love what you’ve done with this... I need all 3 of these ones 😍🙌
I need all of those controllers lol and I think a lime green would be cool
I'm not normally one for bright colours on controllers but you make it look good! 😍
@nookaxcola you and @geeky_diana  made me realize a nice light green DualShock needs to happen 😁 and do it, go get all of those controllers 😬😂
@network_marc_2.0 Im starting a petition for the yellow one haha
Love that purple & berry blue combo😍

@sammyfosgaming oh, also a great choice. In general more pastelle hues would be nice 😁

Ooooo SO BEAUTIFUL 🤩🤩🤩 Yellow is a great shout tbf! 🔥
Gorgeous shot man😍. A nice light blue one would be awesome
@karina_mgs hahaha, well, I know I will eventually buy that PS4 🤦🏾‍♂️ but a solid yellow one (matte please) would be better
@anniekverloop yeah, but its translucent. I need a Solid matte one 😬
@thebobaman4 Thanks! Yeah, they seems to go for darker blue shades mostly. (Or glossy like the recent titanium one) but a light blue one would be great. (And bad for my wallet)

Glad you’re home safely!
Good morning good picture ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I feel like that’s a pretty huge question for someone who spends most of their time surrounded by or thinking of fictional characters 😂 Atm maybe Johnny from Killjoys. Or if we’re talking just video games then Garrus from Mass Effect 💙
That's an incredibly difficult question so I'll restrict myself to crash Bandicoot games and say crash himself, dingodile and cortex 😁
This is so amazing 💖

Shame the team used 4 ults for an already won team fight.
@ross_ritter_ I can only register a Grav+Blade and the Dva bomb and Bob were enemy team 😋
@app.games122 Thankyou for once a decent (easy) blade, kinda hard in today's meta 😂, stun, knockback, stun, sleep 😂
@arcaniumm you forgot the Hanzo ult
@ross_ritter_ Ohh yeah you're right at same time xD
Yo, is it me or is immortality field not as OP as we all thought it would be. 😂😂😂
@throneborn Hahaha its a really good ability...... if you place it correctly lmao 😂😂 he totally fcked it up 😁😁😁 btw they going to nerf the immortality field by 50HP (going to 200)
@throneborn and they gonna buff Tracer 😍😍😍😋😋😋
@arcaniumm ooooof. Well to be real, with all the walls. It’s necessary fr
@arcaniumm Why?! Aren’t  you giving people enough nightmares?!
@throneborn This shield meta is really tough man 😂 they are just never down lmao 😂😂😂
@throneborn Hahahahahaha 😂😂👌👌 jeff thought hmmm reaper is taking over Tracer completely, shot range, heavy damage, self heal so they wanted to make her more viable again by giving her 3 meters extra before damage fall off
@throneborn it was 10 meters and now it starts at 13 meters 😁 so more damage in the end 😎
@arcaniumm Fair enough. I can’t front Reaper is so hard to kill now. Gabriel is out here melting people and teleporting away like nightcrawler.
@ross_ritter_ he’s right I wasted dragons 🐉😂
@eu.profo.ow My grav 😋 hahahaha fighting side by side and fighting for the grav, brother love 😂
@throneborn Hahahaha thats true 😂 can be a pain

Advice, pick what your team needs, not u want :), coz if they dont know how u play so its fine to say that
time for little butchery👹
Dota 2 is not a solo game so when you say idc about what you say i feel like you are a 12 years old kid lol. Dota 2 = team play
I play pudge mainly i single handedly carry almost each game.  Pudge is a very fun and usefull hero. One good hook can change a losing game to a winning one
My support is my carry . I play WITCH DOCTOR CARRY😂😂😂 the hero is cancer
I play pudge.... The most of all the horoes in d2... From d1.... All the way to d2... Still my fav hero .. Dont care what rotten players say... If i want to pick pudge ..i will pick the hero and no one can complain about it 😈
I have over ONE thousand wins with pudge but still ppl say don’t pick pudge 😂😂😂
Gimme pudge and I’ll win u the game in any fucking situation 🔥🔥🔥🔥
@milaadghaedii Ofc i can say that. When someone tells me what would they like to play on lane (when im supp) i pick that. When i suggest someone to pick some hero, they always pretend they're the smartest people on the Earth. So yeah. Balance, right?
@anthnius Yeah, always pointing m that, but still, if i want to play so bad something, i will pick it😊
Ha ha😂😂
@girls_dota_2 yes but you can’t mute your team from begginig if they r not toxic and just want to help in picking some1
@milaadghaedii Ofc i won't mute. I didnt say that at all
@girls_dota_2 okay i will go meepo first pick and get destroyed xD
@anthnius Oh come, u know what i mean😂
Pudge is obviously good in this meta. He got buffed and many play styles can be explored. Only dumb player who said Pudge is useless, he is one of a few heroes who got piercing bkb skills.
@girls_dota_2 y but we all must pick what we need not what we want
This is when the toxic players start complaining down the comments 😂😂
Pudges end up being useless most of the time, though its the players fault still you can say dont pick it its useless
Hail to the Pudgy !! 🔥
@mozeslukas 💪💪😏
most played hero in the game so
He's rlly good in this patch cuz of that frickin regen
If pudge is a shit pick, pick him 😏
@sedwo That's how dota works. "Hey guys, we need a support?" Oh really? No problem! *instant pick carry*
@sedwo but srsly dont pick pudge into slark, thats racist!
@girls_dota_2 me as pos 2 techies
The idea of why people say pudge is bad is that  many people who play him are bad and any person who is plaxing competitive dota, will suggest not picking it due to the fear of nof being able to play it well cause if not played well its like 4v5 all game long and thats a fact. On the Other side , the hero is awesome.
@sedwo pudge is never a shit pick its just works
@girls_dota_2 me as pos 2 techies
@john.mrad Yep, true. But still, why would anyone doubt at me when we play 5 stack? No point...
Like any other hero Pudge needs to be enabled to an extent... he neede some sort of synergy with the heros he’s laning with... many people don’t know how to enable him and they think he’s really bad in lane. But he’s really good if u enable him and can steamroll from early to late game
Rep this noob 😑🤕🚬
@girls_dota_2 its possible that they wanted to play some kind of strat
I picked techies, and they reported me for winning the game :)

The coffeetable aquarium is actually a super cool object! But that's pretty much the only nice thing that comes with my first pet stuff. Well, the snuggle seat isn't that bad either, depends on the colour of course.
Always fab!!!💙💜🌼 Are you interested in being featured next in our gallery? DM me to get more info!

Dobry dzień! 😄 U mnie ostatnio na tapetę weszły 2 pierwsze Borderlandsy. Nakręciłem się trochę przez tę ostatnią premierę i stwierdziłem, że muszę w końcu zabrać się za tę serię. 👍🏻
@geek.disorder Chyba sama za jakiś czas sprawdzę, o co tyle szumu wokół tej serii. 😄
@lambigames w takim razie pogadamy o tym za jakiś czas, gdy już oboje wyrobimy sobie opinię. 😄
@geek.disorder O! Jak najbardziej 😄
Wiedźmin III ❤️❤️❤️ już po raz nasty chyba 😲
@karooli666 Haha 💛💛 To tak jak u mnie 🙈😅
@lambigames taka pogoda że najlepszy jest Wieso
@karooli666 Haha ❤️❤️ i za każdym razem można w nim odkryć coś nowego 😍
@lambigames oj tak 😍 jeszcze nie raz wrócę! Uwielbiam relaks w ten sposób! Nigdy się nie śpieszę z robieniem misji korzystam ile się da z pięknej grafiki, muzyki i dialogów <3

Man im just spending my time in rainbow and gta v
@amirxheikh 😅 is Rainbow playable again?
Spiele noch Borderlands 3 bin noch nicht zufrieder mit meinem Gear 🤣🙈🔥🎮🕹
@electronicstyle7000 😂😂 Da kannst du noch ewig dran arbeiten 😂
Also greedfall ist am Anfang ganz schön Lahm oder? Irgendwelche Laufburschenwege in der Stadt? Ich dachte geht um Monsterhatz
@nerdy.collector so viel ändert sich da nicht. Du bist viel von a nach b unterwegs um dann bei c was zu machen. Die großen Monster gibt es aber nicht sehr viele davon. Du solltest auch auf Schwer oder darüber spielen, weil das Spiel sonst zu einfach ist 😊
@dert0asterz0ckt uff.. dann war das wohl ein Fehlkauf. Aber habe momentan auch mit bl3, remnant und surge 2 zu tun xD
@nerdy.collector also wenn du spiele wie Dragon Age origins magst ist das spiel was für dich, wenn nicht ists eins Fehlkauf 😅 aber mit den beiden Spielen hast du ja auch ordentlich zu tun ^^
Dir auch eine schönes Woche! Ist ja zum Glück einen Arbeitstag weniger. Der Gedanke daran hat mich heute gerettet😂
@_alex.boom_ Dankeschön 😂 ja kann ich verstehen 😂
@dert0asterz0ckt Danke dir! Heute war halt echt der Montag unter den Montagen😂 Lass es dir gut gehen😁👌🏻
@_alex.boom_ das hört sich ja richtig richtig gut an 😑 als wenn Montage nicht schon genug nerven 😂 danke 😊 noch nen schönen abend mit wenig stress wünsche ich dir 😊

Oh so many all nighters me and my bro pulled on Sims 2, sadly getting older one can’t afford all nighters anymore 😍👍🎮 hope you had fun with sims
@the_chic_geek_ Hahaha oh my god 😂😂😂 that's so funny, it's so true! It just looks near on impossible and it wouldn't be good for my stress levels 😂😂
@purplephantom97 seriously 😭😭😭
@gamerdad16 thank you very much! And you dude 🖖 hope you have a good Monday!
@the_happy_gamerino building houses is the best! 😍😍 There are some seriously next level houses on the community page! 😍😍 Hahaha but you seriously do feel like that though 🤓
@queenskye_xo Hahaha gaming twinsies! I've also just downloaded black ops 4.. 😉 Xx
@geeky_diana you would love it I think! The perfect rainy day game!! 😍
@aqla.games Hahaha they're great aren't they 😂 I love a good sims meme! And I haven't played sims 3 in years!! Was so good! And it had sims pets rather than just cats and dogs 😏 ❤️ thank you lovely 😁
@caprianoplays Hahaha that's the thing! There's not enough hours in the day 😂😭❤️
Yes girl this is me 🤣🤣
Ooommggg I used to play SO much Sims back in the day 😂❤️
@aqla.games @_babewiththepowerr okay I will see how much it is in the PS store😁 (easily persuaded 😂)
@_babewiththepowerr oh yay 😱😱🧡
@geeky_diana hahaha amazing 😂😂😂😂
@family_ofgeeks Hahaha 😂 yeeesss 😁❤️😁

Can’t wait to see the finished product! 🔥🙏🏽
@ps4ra thank you! Altho I think I could use more plants 🌿 🤔 heheheh have a good Monday! ❤️
You're a Simsoholic like my girlfriend. She could play it 24 hours a day. Last time I checked on her progress her family had 10th generation. And she plays this game with the longest life span. 😂
Yes🤩
"You can't falloopsinarb" 😂😂😂 I just can't stop laughing 😂
@_babewiththepowerr I see😂 same to you♥️
@geek.disorder Hahaha I go through stages of not playing it for months or and then I'll download it and remember how much fun it is and be obsessed again for a few weeks 😂 a 10th generation is seriously impressive though, I think the most I've ever done is 3 or 4!😂 Have a good Monday 😁
@louichan03 😁❤️
@loonylounisims hahahaa 😂😂😂
Good weekend thanks!
I’m yet to play Sims. I used to be obsessed back in the day ☺️
@_babewiththepowerr it's just "Sims things". 😂 Thank you and you too have a wonderful beginning of the week! 😊
@lealeaa83 haha its a nice game to play all snuggled with a coffee 😁 glad you had a good weekend! ❤️😁
Lol! I love the Sims 💖 I’m currently juggling like 15 different families, attempting the 100 babies challenge 😂 I haven’t played the Magic expansion yet, I’m going to have to download it!
@the_chic_geek_ Hahaha omg 😂😂 the 100 babies challenge looks so stressful though! Have you seen @kelseydangerous sims challenge? She's hilarious 😂😂 yes! I'd recommend it! It's a lot of fun so far 😁
@_babewiththepowerr I’ve a quite addictive personality so I’m not sure I should...... maybe one day - if the wife’s away for a weekend ☺️
@_babewiththepowerr Yes I have! Kelsey is hilarious 😆 And Oh my goodness, yes it’s SO stressful! I’ve had 2 kids taken away from me already because I couldn’t keep up with all of them 😩😂 They won’t grow up fast enough 😂😂
Weekends always seem to disappear nowadays 😭
Good morning! My weekend went far to quickly too 😫. Have a great week 🤙🏻
I used to play Sims a lot back when The Sims 2 came out and my dad used to build houses cause he loved being an architect 😂🖤
💕😂 First overwatch and now sims I’ve been playing the sims lately as well 🧐😂 seems like we enjoy the exact same games at the same time 😂💜
I really want to try the Sims one day😍 it looks like so much fun!!

@thejinxsyndicategaming 😂😂 en casa de mis tíos había un Amstrad... se lo que es esperar a que cargue para jugar 10 minutos y fuera... 😅buena semana!!!❤️
@worldofanaeris Muchiiiiisimo, muchas gracias par de bonitos!!!! Ya mismo habrá que verse no? ❤️❤️
@redbasketyt es una preciosidad!!! Mil gracias tío!!! ❤️❤️
@vidaextraretro Sin duda lo es!!!! 😊😊😊
Ay setin 😍😍😍
@bertocrk Si tío! Mil gracias de verdad, ocupa un lugar de honor en mi Gameroom, junto a su hermana pequeña SNES! Que de recuerdos en una cosa tan pequeñita!
@museo_gamer Que maravilla!!! Pues si me das más señas montamos una búsqueda en IG a ver quién se acuerda! ❤️
@annecromancy Es una preciosidad! Aunque puedes jugar a muchos juegos en Switch, tenerla en la estantería es maravilloso. ❤️ La PS1 fue también una pequeña gran joya!
@saikoland jajajajaja mi madre era más de reñirnos para que la quitáramos! Grandes recuerdos! ❤️
@manuzs_toys lo recuerdo vagamente... al que si le di mucho también fue al Contra... brutal!
@gamers.bcn 😂😂😂 que grande tu! Yo lo intentaba pero mi madre es muy avispada! 😂❤️
@equipo_funko Siiii!!! Tan mono el ahí sentado! ❤️❤️ Gracias!!!
@chiihiro06 Setín el guaperas! ❤️😂
@srbarher Ajajajja yo ponía el termómetro con el mechero y lo ponía a temperatura de 38 hasta que me pillaron 😂😂😂😂
La mía también fue la Nes con el Super Mario Bros 3, fue mi primera gran  herencia 🤣
Los recuerdos de la infancia son lo mejor! yo jugaba a megadrive como un loco jajaja 😁🔥
@beat__86 😂😂 la Megadrive vino justo después de esta... también le dimos lo suyo hasta que llegó la PSX. Saturn pasamos de ella... pobre...
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies Ufff Súper Mario Bros 3! Menudo juegazo! Definiendo las bases de lo que iba a ser Mario! ❤️❤️
@srbarher hombre es la negrita de 16bits de sega lo valía 😁 yo en la época de saturn, psx y 64, le dí muy fuerte al PC con un pentium 1 😂
También fue mi primera consola, y también estaba allí cuando yo llegue jajaja
@javigeek Fue la de muchos de nuestra generación! Luego preguntan que por qué nos gusta tanto Nintendo...
@ytmrcharlie85 Gran consola también Master System! Empezaba ahí la batalla Nintendo-SEGA!
La mia también con el Wild gun man y Super Mario abrís 🙌🙌
@barrygamer SNES!! Consolon! Yo la tuve tarde! Mi padre se pasó a MegaDrive después de la NES, que también dio grandes títulos!
@javialvi19 Grandes juegos!! Yo también tenía un pack con esos juegos + DuckHunt! 👏👏👏
Qué CosA 😅➕ BoniTaaaAAA 😆💗
@javialvi19 La mía me la TiraN 🤪😭🏋️
Qué recuerdos tan bonitos ❤️ mi primera consola fue la Atari 2600 que siempre estuvo allí desde que tengo recuerdos y aunque jugaba el verdadero culpable fue el Amstrad CPC 464 y sus interminables tiempos de carga con esas cintas de cassette 😂😂😂😂 con el Target Renegade, Plaga Galáctica y Navy Moves ❤️❤️❤️❤️ pasa muy bien inicio de semana!!!!
😻😻😻 Espero que la estés disfrutando!!! La primera consola que entro en mi casa fue la Nasa, recuerdo jugar al DuckHunt con mi padre 😅
@taburoto típico, a mí me cogieron mi master system y se la dieron a la beneficencia 😂
Que bonita es 😍😍😍 fotón por cierto 💙💙
Que bonico!!!!🤣🤣
Que la disfrutes amigo! También fue mi primera consola. Qué recuerdos del primer Mario, Zelda I y II, Megaman, y sobre todo Super Mario Bros 3.
También  fue mi primera consola,regalo de mi primo cuando le compraron la Snes,recuerdo jugar muchas horas a pacman,super mario bros y un juego de luchas que no he conseguido localizarlo!!era un cartucho de 4 juegos y uno de ellos era ese!!!
Yo nunca tuve.. todo lo que jugué fue por mis primos! Espero algún día comprarmelaa por lo menos la minii 😊 La primera q tuve fue la ps1!
Que bueno, yo también jugaba con la NES con mi padre y a veces con mi madre, de hecho ellos eran los que se pasaban los niveles difíciles al principio, que grandes recuerdos 😍
Esa también fue mi primera consola pero el juego que más recuerdos me trae es el Cobra Triangle. No sé si lo recordáis, era de una lancha roja que disparaba. Me encantaba.
Que bonita 😁😁 yo tengo tan buenos recuerdos.. horas y horas, intentando hacerme el malo par ano tener que ir al cole y poder jugar.. 😂😂
Que lindisiimo el tooad🙌🙌
@taburoto la verdad que lo es!! (A pesar de ser un emulador con carcasa, en la estantería queda Preciosa)
La mía también! Mi primera consola y con Super Mario 😍😍😍😍
Pues la mía fue Master System y por ahí tengo alguna foto de ella❤️❤️❤️
Entré con SNes pero esta la tengo solo por colección! Buena foto Manu! 😘

Holy moly. So surely this is even rarer than the coveted NWC cart?
That's pretty fancy
@the_baad_man nwc’s have a decent amount made just most aren’t in collectors hands yet. Nintendoage someone has a list with all known numbers.
I remember you showing me this one!  It’s definately a favorite of mine.
@the_baad_man yeah quite possibly. There are many more NWC carts known of and in collectors hands than there are labelled vendor carts for the same events.
Good stuff man
Q bueno eres cabron!!!!

@deadbeatgamer hey @jadenichollex sounds like a challenge
@evyterrific I get it. 😄 There's also another argument for what we do - no one fights for a favourite controller because everybody has their own favourite controller. 😁
@deadbeatgamer hey @jadenichollex sounds like a challenge
Amazing shot there! I really want the purple and rose gold ones 😍 I also want to get a custom one but they pricy 😂

Your post is very cool, well done😎💎If its not difficult, rate my profile too👍👍👍thx
I really wanted the rose gold one but I am going to wait because I haven't been playing much on the PS4 and I want to save money 😁
@minish.princess smart move !
I will pick a few up a bit later 👌
@rebecca488.inthegame thank you 💖
Beautiful controllers 😊
@society_of_aliens thank you 🔥
@evyterrific You're welcome 😊
@dr.mancave there’s coming out other nice one’s too so it’s not a big deal I guess 🔥
Still waiting them to come here so I could buy Rose Gold☺️ Fingers grossed😉
@ekuangemi haha goodluck !! Hope they come there soon 🔥
Your photos are always so nice! 😍 I am not sure if I am going to buy them yet because I just bought the Alpine Green 🤣
Cool!😊 I might go for the rose one 👏. Have a great weekend!😊💕
I got the rosegold one, but the purple one looks awesome too 😍 those new colors are amazing
@kaffeekatzee they are ! 🔥
@gyb.elle nice choice ! They are both amazing 💪
I’ve got that blue one, with bright orange thumb stick extenders!
@kride3 alpine green is also super nice ! ✨  But be quick if you really want them because it where the last ones in my store and they didn’t had the rosegold
Both of these from your pic look great! I didn't buy any of new controllers. I'm happy with my 2 that I own and I don't really need a 3rd one. 😄
@geek.disorder I got 4 now but the black ones are really old so I don’t mind tbh to get a new pair and u never know if there’s friends coming over !
@evyterrific you need to have friends first. 😂 Joking. But we usually bring with us our own controllers. 👍🏻
@evyterrific Yea might have to seriously think about it 🤔😂
Awesome pic dude! My white controller is my baby and I never let anyone touch it😂 now my Nacon controller is my baby too so no one can touch that either 😂
@deadbeatgamer hey @jadenichollex sounds like a challenge
@deadbeatgamer_huw leave it with me
@deadbeatgamer_huw stop encouraging her😂😂
@geek.disorder that’s smart haha I’m not used to that probably because I also play N64 & other more older consoles so if people come over we have what we need haha
@kride3 😂 *little voice* goo gooooo
Looks good. I did not
👏🤟🙃
Aga beee 🚬🚬🚬
That’s a long pistol 😉😋
@rebelreddead 😂😂😂
Sometimes in the wild west, it's easier to find a revolver than a pensil, I feel you brother!😂
@jaimelancaster_rdr2 yep😂
Cracked 🤤 mind checking us out ?
👀I don’t understand why it hurts when you bite your tongue by accident and it doesn’t hurt when you bite it on purpose , I also don’t understand why you are biting your tongue right now , I now want my follow
Hey man you're a 🐐 mind checking me out please 🔥
I love artful graffiti like that. Totally agree that it’s annoying when people use it as an excuse to spray random tags over the top of it!
@deadbeatgamer_huw Indeed ! Normally there’s a code that u don’t tag on new or tagfree buildings. And you don’t put tags or designs over others if it’s more artistic and beautiful than your design / tag. But there’s a lot of toys sadly that ruin it for a lot of artists.
Wow! That really is incredible!!!
@deadbeatgamer  wait this is nothing a bit further in my country there’s an abandoned village full of it. Wanna do some shoots their for my page with a friend soon haha
This looks cool! Zagreb is full of random shit on buildings and I am really mad about that 😐
I think it's a great way to spread some love for art. I've seen a lot of graffiti - smaller, bigger, with or without any message. It's amazing unless it isn't any meaningless doodle.
@geek.disorder 100 % true💪
😍awesome!🔥
Zalige foto! Love this!😍🖤
@aqla.games thanks ! :D 💖
That's so dope 😍
@overdosedgaming thanks 💪
@ps4ra yeah a lot of buildings here too it’s sad ! We have some amazing artists here in Antwerp but there’s also a lot of people who don’t respect the rules of graffiti who fuck it up. :(
👏👏🙌
WOW THIS IS CREATIVE AND CUTE 😰

That transparent green looks fantastic! ✨
Love this color and the transparent 😍💚
@crnnthl the transparant are so amazing !
@kaffeekatzee yeah im so in love with it ! But i really want a neon green one haha 🔥
Mmmm🤔 that’s a nice controller. I’m pretty sure I had the standard plain grey😬
Oh the nostalgia is strong with this one for sure 😍👍🎮 golden eye and mario 64 best games. Well I only played with the grey ones so I guess that one 🤣

The Pokémon edition is my fav - yellow and blue 😎👍🏻
Hallo! How have you been in last few days? I had a lot of stuff to do and I didn't have much time for Instagram. I'm trying to catch up with everything now. 😄
I would love a Red controller with some Yoshi details 😊
@edward_vinsmoke that would be nice !👌
Gorgeous controller and photo ❤️
Gotta go with purple 🤷‍♂️

@shadowzone187 als ge ooit eens nen shoot wilt :D 👌
This looks so cool!! Great shot 🖤💙✨
@punkinmochi thank you 💖
@evyterrific you’re welcome ^_^
Omg, I love him! My favorite is RustTyranomon :3
😍😍 Amazing shot! Unfortunately, I didn't get into Digimon, but I still thought they were cute (and the boyfriend loves Digimon)🙈🙈
😍😍😍
DIGIMON ❤️. Ik vond dat vroeger dus cooler dan Pokémon 😂. En ik ben er toch nog steeds een beetje gek van 😊. Heb je de ps4 spelletjes al gespeeld?😊
@gyb.elle Neen nog niet maar had gezien dat ze er gingen releasen voor de switch !
@cookingwithkirby Yeah think they where super cute but the story at the end was kinda weird haha
@bramble_paw nice !!🔥
@zyrify No thanks man just got a new logo 👌🔥
Nawwwww so cute❤️
@m3lzii6 thanks ! 💖
Gabumon is my favourite 😊
@edward_vinsmoke same 🔥
🔥
cachete
😍♥️✨
Monzaemon! The original teddybear 😍
I liked Gabumon, Agumon and Veemon! 🙌💜 Nice shot! 🖤
@kride3 thanks !!!🔥
@lifeofbathpoopoo haha amazing ! 💖
Love your pictures 😍🖤 have a nice Friday too and thank you for the tag 🖤
Oh I loved gabumon so much 🙆‍♀️ it was a great series nonetheless
@mim.yi yeah me too ! I even had a plush ! Gonna search it soon at my grandma’s place. She normally has a lot of those !
Damn the nostalgia 😂
@hse_timo echt e haha 😂💪
I was more Pokemon😂 cewt shot tho 😊
@deadbeatgamer me too ! But I also liked this but it was just a really weird story in the end. That’s probably why it wasn’t that popular like pokemon
Agumon , Tai and Davis and Veemon were awesome! Those were my favorite Digimon and DigiDestined 😊❤️
@gamer_niels Nice !! 🔥
That is Digimon yeah? Was never a fan because it felt like a pokemon rip off at the time for me 😍👍🎮
Oh I liked to watch that too 😍🔥
I only remember agumon 😂 and that I loved the series. Nice picture!
@chiptacle haha thanks 🔥
@aqla.games it was amazing 👌😂
This one was so cool 🤩! Few min ago passed the ring of Antwerp 😅😅
shoot @drippylane a dm if you’d be interested in promoting us (yes this means free jewelry 🤩)
I loved Digimon, especially season 1 - 3. After that, it got a bit weird for me. But my favorite is Gatomon ❤️
@kaffeekatzee Indeed the last episodes where strange I had the same feeling !
Why does your alexios have a beard mine doesnt?
@gamer.unicorn09 That is brasidas 👀
@onikitsune the last photo i mean
@gamer.unicorn09 it’s not alexios 👀
@onikitsune oh ok
My Favorit  Game😍❤️
This game is indeed beautiful
@mooneriia ikr! the graphics, historical, combat are amazing ! 😍
I love AC, it’s one of my favourite franchises. But I never got on with Odyssey too much.
@retro_licker I love All AC games! In My opinion,  it’s one of the best games that ubisoft made! 😁😁😁 ... give it another chance... if you liked AC origins then you would like this one 😄
@onikitsune I loved Origins, I’ve come back to it twice and made a little more progress. It’s not that I hate it it just hasn’t captivated me yet.
Yellow
@pat_sellars yeah i thought so too 🤙
make it red like mine.. XD

Great game, but hard to come across and SO EXPENSIVE!
Saw the blue box and thought it got a PS4 port. This effing game was always on shelves for like $12 for years and I always said "eh next time" because it was always there at whatever store I went to. Hah!
Man I have this one in my collection but still haven't played it 😒
One of my favourite games, nice.

@jasmin187 Das glaube ich. Kenne da auch ein paar Kandidaten. Die Frage die sich mir stellt ist nur: Warum gibt es den Automaten überhaupt? Das Spiel gibts doch kostenlos auf dem Handy ... Aber vermutlich steht er da, weil es eben Leute gibt, die Geld rein werfen.

Top 5 for sure and one of the first games I ever passed
Jesus this game as a young kid was horrendous. I was so bad at it.
This is my #1
There's gb color hack version.
The best! IMHO
Es ist das beste Jump n Run auf dem Gameboy. 👾🤘💜
My brother got me this for Christmas when it was new and it blew my mind how much more involved it was than the first game.  Super Mario Land was the only Mario game I had ever played until then so I thought that's what Mario games were supposed to be.  This is a great game.
This is one of the best handheld versions of Mario ever!
such an amazing game
It's excellent. I will prob pick up the new DX version of it. Already have first SML in DX mod.
This game was so good it deserves a Zelda links awakening style remake for the switch!
Killed countless hours as a kid playing this.
@anree_gameboy_collector was gonna plug the unofficial dx version. Super cool.
@anree_gameboy_collector do you have the new SML DX that just came out a few months ago? I have yet to see any of those on a cart
👍 i still own this.
It's probably a year ago I bought it. Made in Sweden CiB :) Maybe I should post some pictures of it.
First game I've ever played was Super Mario Land on my Gameboy pocket .

Jugué al out run de nes😁🎮 me encantaba.  Pero me flipan las maquinas árcades ya cada vez es más difícil verlas
@ravenatoys Yo 😂💨💨💨 Empecé con OPERATION WOLF 😭🦅... 😂😂😂😂...
HosTiaaaaAAAA 🏖️🍾💞 TuuuuuUUUUU 🕹️😅 MY OUTRUN
Con 8 😅🥊 o 9 AÑOS 😜🇪🇦
@spardagaming thank you my friend ❤️ hope you have a nice start of the week 😊 it’s very funny yessss 🔝
@ravenatoys como molaba la máquina del Jurassic park tengo que buscar en las fotos de archivo que fijo tengo alguna jugando 😅 con el house of the dead 4 tengo seguro porque las vi el otro día. Qué pena no haber coincidido en ningún recreativo y dedicarnos las dos a mata mata 🤣🤣🤣
I haven't played it but it looks really fun! You just cant beat the arcade feel of some games!
Yo jugaba muchísimo al 1, tenía un vicio que no era normal 🤣 Me  ha encantado recordarlo!!😊
@laleoneradepapa siiii es una pena cada vez está más complicado 😅 deberían ponerse y sacar ediciones nuevas y que volviese toda esa época 🔝❤️ no sabía ni que existía una versión de nes de pequeña tenía el out run para Commodore 64
@taburoto ❤️❤️❤️❤️ es mi primer recuerdo jugando a una máquina recreativa precisamente al Out Run y esa máquina roja que se movía entera 🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🙌🙌🙌🙌❤️❤️❤️❤️
@taburoto un poquitín más pequeña pero poco más anda que no tienes grandes recuerdos 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@jordidelmas es que el Out Run clásico es y era muy muy 🔝🔝🔝 yo lo tenia para Commodore 64 y muy buenos recuerdos, en este juego desde la música hasta la jugabilidad todo 10 😂😂😂😂
@retro_daddy_o yeah some games but the oldies feeling is not the same 😢 if you love arcade racing you must give it a try is a great game 🙌😊
This looks very nice! 👏🔥🔥
Creo que te queda mejor el mismo coche en rojo!!! El amarillo dejamelo a mi 😬😬😬
@javigeek No es broma... Me HibA con los colegas a BarnA 😁🦸... Con 8 AÑOS... PARA JUGAR A LA RECRE... La ChulA 😁 de 100Pesetas.... 😂🍺 NOS ENTRENÁBAMOS ANTES 🥰 EN LAS DE SANTBOI
Siii !! Es genial amiga!
Maravilla atemporal 😍
🔥🔥
Good Morning 🌅 Dear 💐 I have played it back then on the Xbox very funny Game Wish You A Wonderful week 🎮💙🙋🏻‍♂️
En los recreativos era especialista en el de jurasic park y los zombis, me encantaba la pistola y me he pasado dias enteros en los recreativos, salía para comer, cine y a echar la última partida 😂😂😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗🤗🙌🙌🙌

I like how they changed Mickey’s facial expression from a scared to badass 😂 two of the best platforms ever made.
Quackshot also comes in a silver case/cart which is typically one of the cheaper silvers 😁 great pic 👍
Wondefull😍👍☺️
@retroaffaire man, I never noticed that. Yeah they are great platformers. I actually enjoyed World of Illusion more, they don't make platformers like the old Disney games any more unfortunately 👌
@gamertuku Thanks mate, looking forward to getting some of the silver cart/boxes, I don't have any at all currently.
@swizzplayer Thanks 😊👍
@stumotor33na3rd yeah, sadly they don’t make like those anymore. They were a great genre in the ‘90s.

Bp heavies are the easiest attacks to deflect imo, and orochi has the most satisfying deflects.

@the_forest_midget ay you pulled shit like that too sooo
@the_forest_midget also I’m still rusty asf too bro
Holy shit you are back man
@bol4death i just noticed why deflecting is strong  it disorientates your opponent and makes them flustered which makes them more predictable and easier to damage
@fahylachlan But needs a buff against certain heroes such raider or hitokir
@bol4death yeah ur right

Do you even know who you're talking to..? I'd smash my left nut with a rock for doom eternal
@deathstramy now that is some commitment!
Hell yes. I have been waiting since May 2016 for a sequel. Playing on Nightmare now and it is a bit rougher than I remember. Gotta shake the cob webs off.
@notshawn1991 same! It’s taking me longer to pass the levels this time around than I thought it would but I’m also trying to 100% the levels with challenges and secrets so some of that is me wandering around haha. The new combat stuff looks intense though, I’m not sure how I’ll adapt!
@tweakerwolf I like that it will challenge us more. At least the fast combat we are used to. Just gotta learn the new mechanics and enemies.
Caption game improving 🤔

A @gigantkilling le mola este juego, recuerdo que él lo compró en switch 😬
@javigeek esta genial,  además super bien de precio 😁😉
Toda la gente que lo ha jugado le ha encantado, yo no soporto el Basket así que... 😅, buena semana!
No te sientas mal por lo de Fallout 76, no eres el único! 😂. Yo porque lo jugaba con un amigo, que si no... Es un juego vacío de todo.
Ni idea del juego, no tengo ni idea de basket 😅 Creo que me voy a poner con el Last of Us otra vez, pero aún estoy decidiendolo jajaja, mientras tanto estoy con el Theatrhythm Dragon Quest 😻
@barrygamer una pena,  esta muy muy entretenido 😉😁
@gamingnotebook si tío,  una pena.  Ojalá le metan una buena actualización que lo haga algo más divertido 🎮😁
@worldofanaeris que guay,  yo también quiero rejugarlo👏😉 Buen inicio de semana amiga!!!

@scrafygamer si tío los nba normales son demasiado complejo a veces.  Este me encanta 😁🎮
Solo he jugado al NBA 2k16 y me molo mucho, este tiene muy buena pinta! 😁
@saikoland este es más simple que esos nba,  pero para mi más entretenidos😁🎮
Hace ya casi 1 año que dejé Skyrim e iba muy avanzado pero ya me empezó a cansar. Hace poco aparqué The Surge aunque creo que lo retomaré. Se hace un poco coñazo también el mapeado es feucho y el sistema de mejoras no me termina de convencer.
@my_games_rocks the surge me gustaría jugarlo pero es eso,  la primera entrega parce un poco tosca 🎮
Siempre escucho buen feedback the esta serie
@herooftime88 te lo recomiendo,  muy entretenido 😉😁🎮
Jo, como echo de menos mi nes! Y mira que se que ya la tocaría bien poco o nada 🖤
@kawineko si,  pero solo el echo de tenerla.  A mi me encanta,  debes en cuando añado algún juego retro a la colección,  a veces me encanta montarla y evacuar unas partidas😁🎮
👍👍
@rianonino1104 Good day!! 😉🎮
El fallout 76 tampoco me gustó nada, muy aburrido. Me pasó lo mismo que a ti!
@aventurabooks lo empecé con muchas ganas,  y no me pareció nada mal al principio.  Pero cuando comienzas a llevar unas horas... Demasiado pesado y aburrido,  espero que lo actualicen algo más y mejore.  Buen inicio de semana amiga!!!
Pues yo tengo aparcado the sinking city, a ver si lo retomo... Y ayer le estuve dando al remnant un ratito
@ibericangamer Remnant me llama muchísimo la atención,  pero me jode que no salga en físico.  Me gustaría probarlo😁🎮
@laleoneradepapa ya es la putada... Pero esta muy entretenido y bastante chulo
Últimamente solo hago que pillarme juegos y la mayoría  dejarlos de lado pero el que más ganas tengo de volver a retomar es el ni no kuni 2, ahora que ha salido la remasterizacon le tengo muchas ganas.
He dejado de lado el Hollow knight, aunque volveré con el, creo que ahora no era el momento, jugaba un día si dos no y al final siempre me.pasaba el tiempo dando vueltas 🤣
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies yo jugué solo al primero.  La verdad que me encanto.  Anímate y proponte terminarlo😉🎮😁
@gamermistica normal así fijo que le pérdidas el hilo.  Que tengas una gran semana Jess!! 😁
Eso me ha pasado a veces! Estar horas andando y buscando.. y no avanzar nada, lo mejor es cambiar de juego, y si te apetece en un futuro retomarlo!😉👌
@setup_gamer_spain pues si, esperaré a que lo actualicen o algo😅🎮 Buen inicio de semana amigo!!
Tiene muy buena pinta!! Era muy fan de los NBA Jam y este creo que no llega a ese nivel de espectacularidad, pero me parece un juego increíble!!!😊😊👍
Ese lo tengo, pero sin jugar aún, y que pena lo del Fallout... (lo jugaré de aquí 2 años por si le hacen alguna mejora) y ultimamente no he dejado ninguno 😂
@frakergame A mi me está encantando,  la verdad que me tiene enganchado para conseguir los jugadores y mejorarlos.  Y lo bueno que todo se puede conseguir jugando y haciendo los desafíos que ponen diariamente 😁🎮
@gamers.bcn 👏👏 esa es la actitud,  yo siempre que empiezo alguno lo termino.  Pero fallout pudo con migo.  Este nba es super divertido,  lo recomiendo 100%😉🎮
@laleoneradepapa ya le echaré unos partidos más adelante 😁 que me van de lujo los de basket para cambiar el chip 😁
Yeah she just needs a trampoline ffs
@luciomedic 😂😂
Other than that she made an OP main tank, congrats Efi
Wow that’s a lot of damage

@atommanhattan yeah but we shall see how the site looks on wix. 🔥
@phantomlordgaming I've enjoyed my xp w/Wix. I think it'll work out for the best 👍
@atommanhattan Yeah I think you are right. Easier to add people in to edit their own work too saving me doing it lol 😜
@phantomlordgaming That's what I was saying, dude. Burden on the creators, not you. I'm sure it'll be cool as hell by the end of the year. I have a bunch of buddies that are super into the collective voice/media element. You started a good thing, man 😎👍
@atommanhattan thanks dude. Fingers crossed.🔥
@atommanhattan Google Docs is also a good base to look into for drafting; you can open docs for others, which may be advantageous to a multi-voice post.
@atommanhattan Yeah I've used google docs a lot in the past. Great tool.
@phantomlordgaming Great for draft/collab stuff

How often do new maker races start, and which type post should I look for to know
@mason_troyshots Read the post first and then determine how eager we are to start another Maker Race 😊
@mariomaker2_courses wait, is it a separate challenge every week?
@mason_troyshots for the ones in the race, yeah. That's why it's a 'race'. Someone has not been paying attention 😊
@mariomaker2_courses no, sry, I’ve not been on insta a lot lately
Good luck contestants!
I use rule 1 to make the level theme about me
@aram_privv also it has to be the perfect level and it has to show how great I am
@mason_troyshots that's fine, but a little digging through our feed should answer your questions 😋
@aram_privv we miss you Aram 😂

@kirbycola this is wonderful ❤️
very cool @kirbycola thanks
what a funky little lesbian!
Cute!!! 💞
@bankroll.jul keep dreaming
@pouriarjj i was confused too😂
It took me 10 mins to even realise the meme
@qvakesvoid pc = torrent, console = 50$ every game
@till.raw or for 1000$ which can run most games on 100+ fps
@kirav_x_x
@metryal u r matching best console in the world against some shitty pc.Match best with the best :)) then u will realise that ur gay new consoles are shits
@abdi.to.wavyy oh...now i get it😂😂😂😂thanks
Wii....eh 2008...
@abdi.to.wavyy dude u know why didnt he understand this?? Couz iranians pronunce iran difrent way from i ran
@sia.abdolzadeh yes...we call our country (eeraan)...but in english they sat I Ran
Dude thats crazy but I dont even use consoles I just own em to own em 💀
@valerov346 no, not at all. Not every pc player = pirate.
@giraffe_overlordd so i can download whatever i want, or buy, if I’d like it 🤷‍♂️that comment about cash saving
Tfw all the consoles still work thanks to optimization and can still play really old games...
@torentokae not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need
Imagine still making console/pc jokes 🤡
@sonata_2019_ wow😑
@abdi.to.wavyy i guess that's why Iranians didn't get it, we call it "ih raan" not "aai ran"
@metryal I'm a console player myself but dude. just. stop.
@metryal That seems ridiculous. Why would I be so cheap with PCs not being the same
Im iranian :D
@pouriarjj no because you didn't say please
@fraceyv i don't know i really don't care what you have to say
@b.4.r.n.4.b.y every 8 or so years
😂😂😂
@qvakesvoid no they aren't
@till.raw you can get a pc for 500 to 600 euro
When ur good you can build a pc for 100 euro which can plqy gta v on 40 fps
@till.raw GOOD,GAMING
@qvakesvoid yea
Console > PC nahhh, Console < PC, nahhhhh, Console = PC hecc yeah :3
@till.raw good gaming PCs are expensive
@qvakesvoid no they aren’t. Those “good” gaming pc’s are way over the top with what you need to run a game with 60 frames
@metryal as soon as the consloe come out. The price of pc will drop.
@qvakesvoid It depends on what you define as a gaming pc. If you consider a 800 bucks, mid tier PC a gaming pc (which it definitely is) they aren't as expensive but offer way more performance. If you only consider highend or highend+ pc's as gaming pc's it's obviously gonna be hella expensive but honestly, most people buying stuff in that region are either planning to outlife the next console generation as well, just have too much money, just want the best or need the hardware for something completely different from gaming
The only actually expensive ones in the photo are the ps4 and xbox one
@bigmanoops i don't think you know I don't give a fuck
PC waste of money when the playstation and xbox come out
@reza_.ag._ ماینکرافت میمه
@metryal pc beats all
@expo_eyebrows does your pc?
Good gaming PCs are really expansive
@metryal but much worse than most gaming pcs ;)
@carl.grd does your pc do 120 fps and 4k?
I thought it had to do with the state of the countries at first, but I soon found the answer was much simpler.
@qvakesvoid expansive 100
@reza_.ag._ the Iran part means the person ran
@reza_.ag._ so when u find diamonds u technically say yeah man!! which is similar to Yemen. But when u see creeper chasing u say oh man like captain sparklez song Which sounds like Oman When u see a baby zombie with armor u would chicken the fight and run which sounds like Iran or I ran (away) the joke overall wasn’t about the countries themselves but about the names since they sound similar to yeah man, oh man, and I ran
@kyan_merch_link_bio ?
@metryal by the time that Xbox is affordable so will PCs of that caliber
@fraceyv ya except that particular pc will be $1,200 while the new xbox will be $600 brand new
Bruh🤡
@metryal 🤡
@luke_dunning_private you salty clown?
I'm Iranian and I don't get the point
Well as bot console player and pc player i had 1 console before buying pc so pc still to expensive
YEA MAN, AWW MAN, I RUN
It took me 5 minutes to understand the second slide 😂😂
@aldii.y *i ran
@_.sinio._ its because when they see the zombie it says iran - (i)(ran)
Imagine Iran zombie with swiftness potion ...
Still less then a pc
I love PC's but you don't have to upgrade the  consoles every single minute!!!!
That's still cheaper, less than £500 here
@daniellizama26 oh now I get the whole thing 😅
That's still cheaper, less than £500 here
@_.sinio._ cause you are sons of bit*** Iran
@_.sinio._ ye😂😂
All those still ain't worth as much as a top notch PC
@zisis_2004 nah, instead you have to buy new ones
Im persian(iranian)but i dont understand the 2nd slide...
The next xbox will be better than most pcs
I am from Yeah man 🙂💔
@metryal i don't think you know how pc's work
I RAN xD

@sega_museum this game never gets old
This game is nostalgia for me and I also never completed it 😅
@nemuriko.n even me i have never completed this game tried so many times in different phase of my life. 🤣 I'll try again to finish it let's see
I'm mad that I was only able to play this on mobile when it released...and  I never finished it either...but damn I remember that soundtrack tho. Offspring was one of my childhood favorite bands
@jazzydealer i even tried to finish it on mobile version but no luck.. Yes the soundtrack is awesome
😃🔥🔥🔥👍
The ps2 had some very good games for it
Nice collection! You have great games 🎮
Nice 🔥😍

@shiki_the_gravity_boy I actually have it Haha but have yet to play it :p
@ninjagamer1990 oh I agree !!! So many great titles
@sasa_gamesss thank you 🙏

@schizobeard oooo I'll have to look that up !!! Thank you so much 🙏
Ooooooh I totally forgot about ever grace........ 😊
I love it too
I've Had so much fun on this game
That’s badass 🤘🏼
Ich bin auch immer überall die erste. Das war schon immer so und das werde ich auch so weiter machen 😊 ein Urteil über andere bilde ich mir nie nach dem ersten Eindruck sondern immer erst, wenn ich die Person länger kenne. Hab einen schönen Tag 😊
@x_xbadmonkeyx_x yey noch einer der Team Vorbereitung ist :) ja du hast recht aber ich meine mit Vorurteilen tatsächlich nicht mal direkt zu sagen bzw zu denken “ich hab gehört der ist asozial und kifft,ich halte mich von dem fern das solltet IHR auch tun” sondern eher so der Gedanke “hmm sieht bisschen aus wie jemand der gemein zu anderen ist und der kifft,ich werde mal vorsichtig sein” . Meistens beurteilt man auch flott nach dem Aussehen oder was man von anderen gehört hat . Ich hasse das und hab’s hin und wieder selber getan . Vielleicht auch eine Art Schutzreflex meinerseits weil ich mit anderen sooft auf die Nase gefallen bin. Aber mittlerweile hab ich mir das ganz gut abgewohnt :)
@apfelmotte_gaming und dir auch einen schönen Tag Liebes ❤️
Manches was man so denkt ist halt einfach auch menschlich... manchmal kann man da gar nix für glaube ich ^^
👌😍🔝
@x_xbadmonkeyx_x das stimmt :)
Voll schön 😍 tatsächlich schockiert mich das auch immer wieder, wenn ich ein schlechtes Gefühl bei nem Menschen hab, aber dem ganzen trotzdem ne Chance gebe und dann doch merke, dass ich mit allem recht hatte 😅. Ich glaub da muss leider jeder mal durch. Mittlerweile vertraue ich aber mehr meinem Bauchgefühl, als meiner Gutmütigkeit. 😅
@_jass.s_ wie ich schon sagte ich denke das ist auch reiner Selbsterhaltungstrieb. Es ist ja nur natürlich dass wenn man miese Erfahrungen hatte der Kopf sagt “ey pass da mal auf” . Umso schöner wenn man sich auch mal getäuscht hat. Ich freue mich immer ungemein wenn Leute mich kennenlernen und sagen hey ich hab soviel schlechtes uber dich gehört und das stimmt überhaupt nicht” oder eben wenn ich höre die Person soll mies sein und ich merke okay ich sollte vorsichtig sein ,aber nach und nach sehe die hatten nicht recht ,die Person ist super toll” ❤️😂
👍👍
Donuts 😍 guten Morgen
Schwieriges Thema, vor allem auf Social-Media-Plattformen. Wie sollte man auch jemanden „richtig“ einschätzen können, wenn man den Menschen nicht persönlich kennt? Wir sehen nur Profile, Bilder, Worte und lassen uns von anderen leiten. Jeder hat eine subjektive Sicht, daher sollte man sich mit einem Thema oder einer Person erst einmal auseinandersetzen, anstatt immer gleich zu urteilen oder sich von den Geschichten anderen „manipulieren“ zu lassen. Ich finde, man sollte sich erst ein klares Bild von jemanden machen, wenn man über ein gewissen Zeitraum denjenigen persönlich kennenlernt und seine Gestiken, Mimiken und Verhalten sieht. Immerhin ist es easy im Internet etwas vorzuheucheln und jemanden darzustellen, der man am Ende gar nicht ist. Zudem hat jeder seine Schattenseiten. Wenn man alle Meinungen von anderen zu Herzen nimmt & diese auch noch glaubt, wären alle nur voller Hass und keiner würde mehr mit irgendjemandem kommunizieren. Habe schon einige Sachen von der ach so lieben Community gehört, aber diese Fakten toleriere ich und bilde meine ganz eigene Meinung. 😊
Ich hab ne richtig gute Menschenkenntnis. 😅 Auch jetzt auf meiner neuen Arbeit wusste ich bei einer sofort, dass die hinterhältig ist. Hab dann meine anderen Kollegen mal darauf angesprochen wie die das sehen und es hat sich bestätigt dass die Person schon viel Mist gemacht hat. 😅
Ich gebe den Menschen immer erst eine Chance mich zu überzeugen! Hauptsächlich weil ich genau weiß, wie es sich anfühlt vorschnell verurteilt zu werden und ich dadurch immer meine Startschwierigkeiten habe, egal wo. Aber heute sind meine besten Freunde die Menschen, die mir gesagt haben 'am Anfang fand ich dich doof, weil ich dachte du wärst arrogant' 😂 Man liegt mit seinem Eindruck dann doch nicht immer richtig 🙆🏼‍♀️
Sehr schönes Bild! 😍 Ich bin recht scheu und zurückhaltend wenn ich auf neue Menschen treffe. 1. weil ich vom Wesen so bin und 2. um mir einen Eindruck vom Gegenüber zu machen. Ich liege oft richtig mit meiner Einschätzung, aber manchmal wird man auch überrascht ☺️
Ich glaube Menschenkenntnis ist bei mir groß vorhanden aber ich muss auch gefühlt immer wieder sagen Leute nicht voreilig irgendwas denken, oft gibt es Gründe fürs handeln und denken anderer... erstmal abchecken und dann urteilen, oder vllt sogar helfen und und ach das kann man weit fächern :)

@gr4ysen after effects
@calcul8ted how long have u been using after effects ?
I hope to go to a tc in the near future @sassyangel112
@chefshabbatv The best was of course getting to meet people irl! The worst was probably arguing at the streamlabs booth 😂 they kept telling us to come back the line is too long, but when we were waiting they let others just walk up and get in line knowing we were waiting.
@marcus.ice554 I definitely recommend! It's so worth it!
@sassyangel112 yesss! Just dm when you're going to be on 🙂
@sassyangel112 I just have to save up so much money and airfare between now and next year so yea that’s that nothing is cheap flying anymore
@sassyangel112 ouch that has to be annoying getting your spot taken for other people’s foolishness but I’m glad you got to meet some people irl that’s the beauty of twitch, who was your favorite you met for the whole trip?
Hopefully it was in Texas
Nice post their better than mine😂
Super Fun Weekend🙏🏼
@marcus.ice554 Yea very true! It's not cheap. The flight was the most expensive thing which is crazy!
@jeikobs_potato The con was in California
@sassyangel112 yea that’s why if ur going to future conventions just go with a friend or too lol haha it definitely makes sense
@sassyangel112 I Know
@marcus.ice554 yea we got an Airbnb so it saved money that way!
@sassyangel112 yea I heard about them their flights are decent tho
How much you paid for it flight

@tech.ninjas just a waste of space. 1 monitor and it isnt even an ultrawide?? Id prefer my 6 monitor window any day of the week. 1080ti powering my main and my vr headsets while the 980ti runs the other 5. No room on there to add a stream deck or other perphs AND looks like you gotta move that tray to squeeze between the chair and monitor to sit down... yeah ima say no chief.
@thetruegreenman we all have our.  Opinions mate
@tech.ninjas but this is a waste of space. It looks nice yes but its like puttin 13” tires on a rari, you just look like a fool

u shouldn’t be putting you’re desktop on the floor, this way u will have to clean it more often because when it’s on the ground it will suck up a lot more dust instead of when it’s properly placed on a table where it’s almost dustfree

@2ndtimearoundtoysandcomics would PayPal you to copp one for me🙌🙌🙌
Where is this located at?
@thosetuckerboyz
WHAAAAAAAAAA?! 🔥🔥🔥
Freakin awesome!!!
I want it 💙💙💙
Wtf is this is this legit ?
Omg I would have bought it on the spot
Sorry guys, but there’s one less on the market today as it’s all MINE!
@rendezvous_point_toys wow, you getting that?
Buy it u wont
Holy crap. 399???? $100 more than the rest
@kurtyberty why don't we live in America?
John Wick creepin around the corner.
Anyone grab a UPC code?
@fontenotd1 it's a 4 top and comes with the custom riser. Those are my only thoughts as to why it's more.
@thelabcoatguy @markhussey @picturs4u2 not vintage but stillll
@alexplatzk 👊
@amandaleigh974  I want it
Even though does not make much sense to have a lower grade cabinet for each game vs having a high end MAME machine, this one is cool looking. TMNT an Turtles in time? Do you know, are they the original games by Konami or clones?
@ct_toy_hunts thank you 🙏🏽
Just for 399, buy yourself a pewds chair for just 399 better and it’s for pewds
😯!!!
Whaaaaaaat?
I thought it was going to be $299?
😳😳😳🤯🤯think I'm gonna have to drop 4 bills if I see dat in hawaii!!!!!!@
No way!!!!
@tomfox5150
@yenykm_
@2ndtimearoundtoysandcomics damn! I was a the Norwalk one yesterday and nothing. Hopefully they start showing up closer to home.
Nice.. the price is not bad too.. lol
The thing that's scaring me is john wick in the back ready for a kill🤣
Want it!
@erickson.stacy
@marinette_2376 neeeeeeeeeed👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Someone send me one to England
@beautyw_nikki the hunt begins
SOLD OUT ONLINE 😥😥😥
Not at ours!
@motudoobs yes
@htowne21 Walmart
The John Wick movie is out?!
Yeah but which Walmart? What state?
@2ndtimearoundtoysandcomics you wouldn’t happen to get the SKU# did you...😬
Finally a good one💯👏
Dang, time to search for one. Wallmart exclusive?
@mrld_rcher Connecticut
@htowne21 No, not my post
What city/state is this at?
@htowne21 SKU is in a @toyshiz post
@thatsmrplayboy2you Connecticut
@8bitvoorhees awesome thanks!
Keanu looks determined, yet cautious about making the purchase.
Maricooo mira cuando cuesta @aliengraff  coño de su madre
@belibooop
The John Wick movie is out?!
Not worth $400.
@henner_nation
Oh wow....
Damn $400 this time round? I bought my rampage one for $300
@8bitvoorhees How do you like it? Is the cabinet sturdy? Worth the 300?
@tmnttoyphotography yeah, its pretty sturdy, ive moved it all over the house since putting it together with no problems, deff need the riser for it, i plan on getting this one and the marvel one, i also have the street fighter one
Where???
Does it come with the riser for $400?
😔
Really!!!

Facts
the best things about reach is not only is the storyline hecking amazing but your customized character is in the cutscene
@halo4ever1996
U forgot the bag with the ak 47 and the Ar 15
Reach was an amazing game until everyone died. Which made everything inside me of reach fall apart :( . Rip noble 6 and his team
@bariscaliser Halo Reach (The best halo)

He looks cute! Nice 😄
@rokassutkus thanks!! I was actually pleasantly surprised with how it turned out
That's adorable
@abra.bee thanks youuuuu 😊
ever played castlevania symphony of the night
@nick.noel_ YES!! I love that game
@bvgsy_ i fucking love castlevania i wanna play more i also have rondo of blood but it’s really hard
@nick.noel_ i wanna play more too, I haven't played any besides Symphony of the night tho. I've watched the Castlevania cartoon on Netflix tho, and that was 🔥
@bvgsy_ where tf the third season at tho 😡
@nick.noel_ lol honestlyyyyy. I doubt it'll come out any time soon tho. Since the director of the last two is working on a Devil May Cry cartoon now, I believe.
Go like my recent! Plz

@pubg.waliii thanks 😂
Mountains were fine they were tall and filled with stone swamps are ass, they legit have two uses, witch farms and slime farms but no one wants to be there.
Swamps for shrek

@jeanjeannnot AanD TRREEEEEEEEE
Mountains for goats 🐐
Swamps

Just have even vote
@x2buller why controversial lol
Bruh that Chucky is lowkey terrifying lmao get that fnaf lookinass outta here
@rennymikekhan you’ll have to talk it over with my manager @drew_p.balls
@x2buller oh that’s nasty, it was a lot more laid back when Nolan was in charge of it, he made the main dish pizza because he thought it be hard for his employees to screw it up lol
@x2buller how are you gonna say it’s controversial then go on to say “in fact my claim is correct “. I work at CEC and I can tell you first hand that reusing pizza is not a thing at any of our stores.
@cactus_machine HOW DARE YOU?
@x2buller That was a lie. People take their pizzas home if they don't eat the whole thing at the store, just like any other pizza place.
@epic_vg_facts It's not true. The guy made it up.
What a god
Was there ever a chuck e cheese Atari game?
@cactus_machine HOW DARE YOU
@deedoo_r I actually don’t know, would’ve been cool
@epic_vg_facts looks like you have an opening in your schedule 237 years from now
@kobun37 I'm sorry about that! I just heard it from Shane Dawson. Won't do it again! I greatly apologize for that. I wasn't sure I should've done more research.
@chuckster_cec My claim isn't correct it's just what I've heard. I'm sorry!
@x2buller it’s all good you don’t have to be sorry. I like that we can all share information and inform each other here on my account, the gaming community is so great and friendly
@clam_the_scout yeah Nolan bushnell really was, he made the first arcade machine, helped create pong, and he gave Steve Jobs a job when he was circling Atari headquarters with no shoes when his employees wanted to call the cops. He took him in and taught him how to work with technology and computers
@epic_vg_facts It's just I felt bad about now getting misinformation. Thank you though for being on my side!
@x2buller yeah np you didn’t really misinform anyone we just had a fun little debate about it
@epic_vg_facts Yeah! It's just honestly I felt bad about it. Because sometimes I don't say my claims are right. Thankfully everything seems to be okay now.
What? That's actually insane! He not only put an underrated console to life but now a controversial pizza place too.
Awesome!!! Also, your switch looks awesome with the white joy-cons!!!
@wyldesmf Thanks! The back is mint green.  Because why not? Lol
@poprewind Now it’s even better!!!

I can just never get these moments dude. Every-time I do it the peace just gives me the middle finger and is like “11 damage, take it or leave it”
@twitchkichie Hit your shots. 🙂
@secret_gundam listen normie. The peace hipfire is gay.
@twitchkichie It only works when you aim center mass.
@twitchkichie If you are, blame your internet. 🙁
@secret_gundam it’s just lag shh :>
I need to learn wall jump after you said it’s possible on console I fr need to try :0
@official.spooky.gurl Anything’s possible.

My ping once reached like 150,000 and I fell through the map and got shot back to spawn before not even being able to move

Hello guys. Nice day right. I totally agree. Well I want to introduce you all to binary option trade, a trade where you invest specified capital and earn massively(larger profit). Contact @andryeyvladeemeer to get more info and get started.
Haha. Dude, I don’t play much any more but when I do, this reaction is a regular occurrence.
@andyslarsen 100% and every single time I play I promise myself I won’t do it, then I end up with a broken controller and a pissed off wife 😂😂

It's an awesome place and was lucky enough to see it earlier this year 😁🎮👍
@xbox.controllers it is insane! Did you get the chance to go swim in cenote?!
@josh_doberman Yes but not in the one on that site. They took us to one a bit further away which had hollowed out the ground but still had a roof which you were not allowed to stand on at ground level as it was so fragile. The one you went in looks amazing, it's a very long day if you went from Cancun like we did 🤣
@xbox.controllers yeah took like 3 hours to get there😂 but that’s weird cuz the one I went to is like only a mile away lol but glad you had fun this place is amazing!🤙

@trey_dragon_13 It’s how the picture is
@repostracc oh wtf
Duuuuuude that mako pad controller was awesome!!!! I still have mine but the top of the joy stick is missing.
@cal_game_collector It’s funny, playing a 3 or 4 player game, no one wanted to get stuck with the MakoPad back in the day but it’s such a precursor to the Brawler64 controller. I definitely have a new appreciation for it all of these years later (and the joystick is definitely usable).
@nycgamecollector with my family it was practically a fight for it because of the turbo button. It was like an u fair advantage on Mario Kart. That golden mushroom goes crazy fast on turbo lol
@cal_game_collector I’m gonna have to try that out, thanks

@retrogamer.90 solid choice 😊 i play it on my flashcart sometimes 🔥🎮
@silverskull_customs can't go wrong with that entry 😊
@420bit__blast_processing 🔥🎮
@wolfwoodtg it was a flawed game but overall I thought it was a pretty solid transition to 3d 😊 least it's no where near as bad as all the gameboy ports ha
@_64ce_ I play it on PlayStation 😏
@retrogamer.90 heard the PlayStation version is even better than the N64 version 😊 either way I nearly broke my controller a few times playing it 😂
@_64ce_ yeah it is and your controller 😂🤦‍♂️

MKII
@ixrock ay that game is always good 🔥
MKII, MK Trilogy, MK9 and MK11 are all my favourites. Let's not forget the masterpiece that is Shaolin Monks also! ❤️
@blackbeard.sr71 ooo all great titles! I really enjoyed the one on ps3 too 😊
mortal kombat deception was my fav!! the story mode kicked ass
@90s_gamerguy nice choice 🔥
I played the crap out of this one. So much better than the ever-loading PS1 version😅
@gidionv666 true dat 😂😎
Loved the endings! About the worst cutscenes ever, but I loved them lol
@jump_jab_arcade the cheesiness is what made them great 😂
I love the first one on the Sega mega drive, bought it because I heard some good things about it being Just like the arcade version, absolutely loved it!❤️
Mortal Kombat 1 was good Mortal Kombat II was the first great Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat 4 that one was a tough one for me the 3D Graphics just didn't seem to work for it in my opinion
🔥❤️
Mortal Kombat Trilogy (my fav)

Imma miss this anime soo much as well, i really hope theres a second season
@a.fading.no.one I’m sure there will be. With already a movie announced, and it’s popularity soaring I think the smart business move would be to bring Tanjiro and the gang back for another season.
@lorenzo_leads helll yeaa
What anime is this? I need to check it out

Still, one of the greatest players I've had the privilege to run alongside. Great comeback bro!
In 24 hours that Tether shot will one shot body just like D1, I am excited
@nolan_lemaistre Me too. Just disappointed it took Bungie 3 years to finally do it.
@emik234 You know. You've stuck around since the very beginning. Back when I wasn't even this decently sized page. Back when Trials was still a thing. I still remember the clutch plays that you had that helped out myself and @lonexwolflegend. You and your bouncing Fighting Lion shots. Eagle doesn't forget those memories. 💯🔥
@eagleeyereyes great moments that are seriously missed man! Keep up the amazing work. Still watching from the sidelines and cheering you on!
Look at all those views 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@eagleeyereyes 2*
@zeke_stock two full years, but as of September 6th, 2019 we are technically at the beginning of the third year
@zeke_stock It's 3.
@eagleeyereyes it’s going to be year 3, but it’s been 2 years since D2 came out
@zeke_stock I count the major updates as the years, not the technicalities of actual years seeing how Destiny was released in September. It's closer towards the ending of the year. From Shadowkeep until the new year, this is presumably the last majority update of the year. So, with the major changes from y1 adding in special weapon slots, and y2 new subclasses, this will be the 3rd. So, in my opinion, it's 3 years.
I love you Eagle. Soar high
Was watching when this happened, really amazing plays.
God that was cringe-
Good stuff man
kudos to you omg

@handpressofficial I am morally confused about your account but I kind of love them
Oh god these are awesome!! ❤️❤️❤️ someone needs to be drafted to the design team ASAP like 2 generations ago lol gen 7 Was meh and gen 8 is looking especially suspect! We need you ! @shinygazza
No
@purpl3haze1992 💯 hell yes
@marc_.021 thats what they shouldve been
Way better... It's sad Nintendo won't ever come to the community for new Pokémon ideas
Original Snivy, but this Oshawott and Tepig! They're so cute!!
Oshawott is much better like this 😅

Dang these are lit! I want them all

That tepig looks way better then the original imo
1903 8488 9341
No, I mean, they look good and all, but they aren't as good as the originals
They’re cute, but I like the originals better
Oh that’s hot. Almost as hot as my hand press videos.
These are way better than the originals!
Great reimaginings

9068 3572 3654
9024 0213 5754
Tepig is 1000 times better
Look how you massacred my snivy
These look more attractive ! The design is impeccable!! 👏👏👏👏
Much better than the original! Unova was my least favorite set of starters 😭
356931730433👏👏👏
3528 0719 3921
Amazing!!
Gen 2 and 5 best gen
the design of the grass type pokemon is super weak.
Tepig’s is better Snivy’s is worse and Oshawot could be either
yes oh yes so much over original starters
I think Tepig looks way better tbh.
Funny fusions!

Ghosts n Goblins
👏👏
That's Ghosts & Goblins.  It was on display at Wal-Mart the other day in the Electronics section as a crappy off-the-shelf MAME cabinet with four CapCom titles.  I had some time to kill, so I played one game and reached the fourth boss.  It's a tough game, and on the NES it's next to impossible.

@portal_paranarnia esperemos que siga vivo 💚 😊
@randomshowstream o que eu espero de verdade é o multiplayer também🙌 kkk❤️❤️
@portal_paranarnia de salida no, pero mas adelante va haber multiplayer 😊
@randomshowstream sim eu sei 😢 acho que o multiplayer vai ficar somente pra play5
@portal_paranarnia Uuh enserio? 😢 espero que no hagan eso, por que si sale para ps4 el multiplayers tiene que ser en ps4 tambien
Habra que esperar a ver que pasa :(
@randomshowstream ao que tudo indica, boatos e interpretação de notícia será pra play5 somente. Mas eu espero estar errada🙌
@portal_paranarnia 😢 espero que si, que se den cuenta de que estan cometiendo un error, por que no todo el mundo se va a poder permitir comprar una ps5 :/
@portal_paranarnia Y sacar un juego en ps4 para despues sacar el multiplayer para ps5 me parece hn gran error de parte de los desarrolladores, pero bueno, habra que esperar 😢

I killed Ghost Bizzle in my recent! Go check it out, I liked your post btw 😀💓
Colors are amazing ! Love how you angled it too 🤘🏻
Gorgeous shot sir!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌
These colors are popping 🤩💥
@ppr.kut thanks man!!
I joined the waitlist thanks to this picture 😡. But great composition my friend👌🏻 Always dig how you use the buildings in your area to make the shot.  One day I will venture outside with my toys 😆
@capes.and.rifles if and when you do- make sure you bring paper towels and a cleaning product with you- I forgot yesterday and had to get my hands super dirty to clean off the places I wanted spidey to sit 😖 but hey- glad you joined the waitlist! No harm in trying right ?
@eyeofuatu good point.  I actually have doorman gloves sitting in my amazon cart for that day.
Hands down my favorite Hot Toys Spidey thus far.
Spectacular work Sir🍻🍻
My sweet god of spider, I thank you for blessing my eyes with such wondrous 8 legged beauty. The shroud has been lifted and all I see are glorious colors and exceptional exuberance. Which all translates to: this is sexy 😍🙌🙌
@theonecam your comments always make my cheeks turn scarlet ☺️
@red_dog_5 thank you so much Paul! Really appreciate it man🙏🏼
@rollthehardsixx did you ever jump on the waitlist ‘just in case’? You never know, what could happen! But hey in the meantime I’ll try to do my best to keep the Ben sized hole in your life filled with pictures! Thank you always my good friend- you da best (and I will deny ever saying that if we meet in person 😂)
@529_jay haha darn straight!! Even for us stuck at desks all day too 😂😂 thank you Jay!🙌🏼🙌🏼
@eyeofuatu I bought this the same minute you did 😆 This and Maul is being held hostage at Sideshow 🙄
@eyeofuatu hahah Ben there, done that
@rollthehardsixx oh right! Whoops sorry 😅
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Spectacular sh😍t 🔥
This guy is beautiful! Amazing shot man. For me Ben Riley's character design is the best thing to come out of the Clone Saga
Such a excellent and beautiful work!! I’ve always love Spidey! 😍😍😍😍 Happy International Coffee Day! 😊
Amaizng work! Coffee to start a day is a must especially for superheroes! 👏🏽
Holy crap this is amazing Tom!! 😍😍 the colors are so vibrant, and it looks like a shot ripped straight from the game itself, well done 🔥🔥
Beautiful beautiful shot man! The colors are so nice with the striking red against the blue city background. I usually don’t prefer shots with the camera tilted diagonally rather than level but it works so well in this photo and it was the best way to frame it. Truly excellent work Tom👏👏👏
Awesome shot Tom!!🔥📸🔥
Might be a little tricky to drink that coffee with that outfit 😂 excellent shot, the background looks absolutely amazing 😻😻
@missbincaboo 😂😂😂
Goddamn 😱
Wow, this is cool! 😎
Awesome shot bro 🤩👏👏👏Really love coffee too😂☕☕
🤩 👍
Cant wait to visit so I can shoot this guy 🙌. He works so good with your rooftop 👌
Superb! Can’t wait to get mine. They change mine for october!!!
What a shot to honour your dream figure! 😍📸👌
Beautifully done man! Really stunning figure!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
So beautiful! 👌
He looks so perfectly on scale with the city from how you angled this that I'd swear this is a real life Spidey enjoying his addictive caffeine/social media combo! 👌🏻
What a figure! And some amazing shots to showcase him
Coffee and buds = balance. I’m not giving up either one. 😂 Great  shot dude! Only other thing needed with this figure is a half masked head to go with the food accessories.
The colours are just so awesome. This is one great figure and so much justice done to it by you sir!
Yesss!!! 🤩🤩🤩 That blue and white background and it's pattern is absolutely gorgeous behind this incredible figure and all its details 😱😱😱😱
@prayogi_war appreciate it man🙏🏼
@grownmentoys you dead? Get back to life!! There’s too many toys to collect to be dying now!!
@hanifhimself thank you Han!
This ia waaayy cool brother 🔥🔥🔥
@eyeofuatu you’re welcome man ! Love your page 👊🏼
Yeah, this dude looks pretty rad.
Yay!! He's such a beauty! 😍😢😍😢 Incredible bright colors, so vivid and alive! Love the backdrop and what a great angle! You really brought Ben to life! Truly AMAZING work, MY BRO!!! 👏👏👏🔥🔥😍😍😍☕️☕️☕️☕️
Smashing Scarlet Spider Shot 😍👏👏 Been waiting for this shoe since you first shared you were getting everyone’s favourite Spider-Clone and you nailed it!! Also Coffee is the King of all beverages 🤤
Wow. Incredible.
Beautiful shot Tom! So happy that you’ve got your “grail” fig! Hopefully Hot Toys will grace us with a Master Chief one day!
I know those buildings! 😂 Such a gorgeous figure. You really make those colors pop too. 🔥
@biojexphoto hahaha, yes- blend allllll the mind altering substances! Truly the only right answer 🥴😂 and thank you Elliot! Trust me there was no way in hell I was missing out on this guy- we’re talking top 5 favorite characters of all time material here😆
@qlawtoypix I absolutely agree!!in hand he’s so outrageously detailed it’s insane 😍 thank you so much Quinn! 🙌🏼
@betzaidae thanks Betz!! It’s kinda crazy the color the building came out in the shot because it’s actually more dark and warm in terms of color- but I think because spidey was sitting on the inside ledge of the garage for this shot cast in shadow that when I went to color balance out the backlighting it made it this crazy blue and white! I dug it- and happy to hear you do too! 😆🙌🏼
@dagobah_days whooa, now that just blew my mind 🤯 I don’t know why I never thought of a @hottoyscollectibles master chief, but holy crap- now it NEEDS to happen!! 😱 thank you so much Dakota! 🙌🏼
@eyeofuatu it’s been stewing in my mind for as long as I’ve been a Hot Toys fanboy. I’ve only owned a few from them, but I know they would absolutely murder Chief. 3A did a 1/6 version and it got “meh” reviews so I didn’t pull the trigger
@chaxtagram thank you so much man!!
@intangibledandy I’m completely smitten with him 🥰🥰
Amazing is an understatement for this masterpiece! Such a cool figure/suit and you captured it so well! Happy to hear you got your grail fig and I share in your coffee love! 💯👏🏻🕷️🕸️🔥
This is freaking awesome! And that figure may be one of the coolest hot toys of all time
@thesedamntoys lol, how dare you 😂😂 well I know who I’m not putting in charge of the clone factory, to many human rights violations under your command😂 thanks dude!
Damn glad you got this figure because this shot is absurdly perfect. I love how you have the perfect location for Spidey and damn well know how to use it. And yes. Coffee is the true winner of life 😂 and if it’s Irish coffee...well that’s even better 😏
Love it Tom! 😍
Sweet!!! This fig may resurrect me!!!!
Nice 👍
Nice
This shot is 🔥
So amazing

What's the point of that dinosaur that has charge but can't attack heros that turn
@dj_moosetk_102_others combos that imply no playing the card but havin it on board, like recruit or cube 🤔
@frtve.pygmy oohhhhhh makes sense now
No
Hahaha
@dj_moosetk_102_others Also, this Card was designed before Witchwood in which they actually featured Rush for the first Time.
@angry_treant oh also makes sense
@spartacusfett repost :/
@amir.h___gh busted.
OTK bad, Blizzard says
😂
Way too overpowered screw that 👌
Charge doesn't exist anymore. Blizzard too scared of burst face damage so they only print rush now
@dj_moosetk_102_others If you silence him would he would go back to sleep for the turn he was played on?
@reese.egressy if you play him and he is silenced that turn ya but if it's the next turn and he's silenced them nothing changes
@pyxroclvout no no no
YES

Hey Man I’m Trying To Get Some Feedback On My Recent You Don’t Have To Follow Me Just Want Feedback😌
U copied my song after u said u weren’t smh
@anncj96
@queen_arale_chan I don’t hate on Sun and Moon for its artstyle. It’s not my favorite artstyle but I can deal with it. Instead I dislike the S&M anime because it brings TOO much new to the table. It feels more like a Slice of Life anime rather than the Pokémon anime. Plus I feel like S&M was an incredibly underdeserved win. I mean he had like 2 evolved Pokémon so something must’ve gone wrong in Alola because there were no serious threats in the league. Like in Sinnoh which had one of his best and most developed teams, he had Paul and Tobias’ cheating ass (which the anime needs to bring him back for more backstory.) In Kalos which realistically should’ve been his first win, he had Alain which posed an actual threat to him and it turned out that Alain was too much for ash to handle and he gratefully took 2nd place. I wouldn’t have had a problem if he would’ve gotten 8th or even 4th but he really shouldn’t have won this league. Imo this win is gonna be the only thing keeping the S&M anime from being forgettable.
İyi dedin kral
@queen_arale_chan I'm just salty cuz he should've won in sinnoh and kalos
Pokemon is clearly trolling
@rosiepkmn I'm mostly mad about how bad his team was and how bad of a trainer he was compared to XYZ, DP, and honestly RS
@saulfrost10 same
My god everyone stop crying
@oscarpier16 and thats how he will lose and i am so excited
@letsstayunnamed right? His eyes are too close together, I'm just not used to this style
Let 👏 Ash 👏 be 👏 a winner 👏for👏once 👏in👏his 👏stupid 👏crummy 👏life
@saulfrost10 same
So damn true
After he wins ma boi guzzlord just fell down from heaven
Is Steven Universe Ash canon?
@roxas.13keyblade I thought it was the art style. Yeah i wish he had a full team
Oh a strong team like XY
@elisy_pisy 😭
Rowlet cheated, fuck. This
tf is that?
@evancalum_
Yeah we did
Idc about art style
Im not disappointed. Im just mad that you hated how ash won SIMPLY because the art style.
You are not a clown, you are the entire circus
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 S tier meme
Anybody that salty that he won because of sun and moon art style is honestly stupid Sun and Moon needs to get the credit it deserves it brought something new to the table the Side Stories and slice-of-life elements  is entertaining, it brought back fan favorites and it had a lot of the mainstream involved with the series since joto or even Hoenn while yes X and Y was the best season for battles and was pretty much eye candy there are other Seasons that easily beat it regarding storytelling and for anybody that's going to reply I'm not going to take your comment seriously if you're going to say Serena is the only evidence for it being a character developmental story also X and Y did poorly in Japan especially the movies by the way
@queen_arale_chan Preach ❤ I so thouroughly enjoyed sun&moon. Although at first it felt like it had developed backwards and gotten more childish, the story was so fun! Just like the Sun&Moon games!  Theres so much to explore snd check out in terms of pokemon too but culture and unserstanding!
What the fuck is up with Pikachu's face
The drawings represent life in 1999 vs 2019. That’s exactally it. They screwed us all
To be fair, he has to beat Kukui to be considered Champion
I don't understand the hate
@queen_arale_chan Nice explanation you gave there. But, XY will be superior.
Probably A Link Between Worlds, but I'm still a sucker for Link's Awakening too. I mean... ALBW is masterpiece levels of game design, but I think LA being a big middle finger to the concept of the Zelda timeline still wins it brownie points.
My favourite has gotta be A Link Between Worlds but I really enjoyed Minish Cap too! Even though I didn't even play it on a handheld console - I have it on Wii U 😂💕
@crankyeagle I played minish cap on my mum’s old 3DS (she downloaded GBA games as part of the ambassador program) before it got stolen. Then I ended up just buying it for GBA cause I love it too much not to have it
@samuelryanlilly Link’s Awakening is so quirky, I love it
Loved Ages/Seasons but I haven’t played them in so long! Definitely need to revisit them.
@supernintendad Who knows, maybe they’ll be released on switch
@goodgaymesp that’d be great! They’re super underrated games in my opinion
You deserve wayyy more followers!
@thehyliangaymer that’s so sweet ❤️
Well, Majora's Mask was released on 3DS, so... 😁 But otherwise, I'd have to agree that A Link Between Worlds is amazin! Love it 🙌 what's your favourite?
@sckl.mariomaker2 A Link Between Worlds, closely followed by Minish Cap
Ahh, I want them all!! 😍😍

I've heard a lot about this game. Is it good?
Ooh teach me how to do lineart 😍😍 you’re really good at inking!!!
@wraythskitzofrenik is is so good and much more than that.the mistake they made was releasing at the same time as Skyrim, so it was shadowed. It's so good, I HIGHLY recommend it! I've just began yet another playthrough after just recently beating it.
@brencartoons aww thank you!! Considering my hand isn't the steadiest, I'm surprised by my own lineart 😂❤️
The inking is so wonderful 😭❤️❤️❤️ I love especially the delicate features of her face oh mygod

Barcode game 😱 insanely cool idea 😂
I remember seeing something like that, but dragonball.🤩🤩🙌🙌
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies Yes!!! Barcode Wars by bandai has a dragon ball edition! I really want that too 😭
@backlog_chan The premises is great. But what you see is kids aggressively slashing cards while all you see is black and white numbers and beeping sound. 😂
@knit.color データックですね！めちゃくちゃ欲しいやつです 😭 バンダイから発売されたバーコードウォーズっていうのでドラゴンボールバージョンがありまして、それも持ってないです 😞
Hoo boy, I had this growing up but had to rely on barcodes from cereal packs and toys to hopefully get a good character. Fun times 😅
@ongakugamer If I had this game in my childhood I'd be the coolest kid in the block 😂
@backlog_chan 🤣
@gspotgaming Ohhhh i also did that for the Digivices 😂 Good times
Never tryed this but its so much cool😍
I almost read Conbini wars 😂
@takumi_senpai Close enough 😉
@shigure.games Yes!! 😉 And its quite cheap to get!
Wow.. curious.. 😁
@ojogadorx Fun with a friend 😂
It's great what you publish about the Barcode 😍 I frankly didn't know! 😮 However, it seems that the idea of the Barcode, and the cards, had a strong impact on Nintendo because the E-reader for the Game Boy Advance closely resembles the Barcode 😮😮🎮
@seeckt.von Ah yes you are right!! 😆
I've always wanted to get a barcode battler since i was a kid they always looked like alot of fun
@addi.stan Its not that fun playing alone.. 😢 but i think it would be alot of fun with a mate! If alone then you could use it for the SFC games of course. 😁

Happened to me all the time in ttyd when I had to equip the cricket badge for the hooktail battle
tbh on my first playthrough (i was 5 okay) i didn’t really equip badges until several chs in bc the tutorial from goompa confused me. like he taught you how to equip it and then made you dequip it and i didn’t realize the dequipping part so i was really confused when he said i didn’t have the badge equipped a few min afterward
so i actually had a hard time with the goomba bros in the prologue bc of that, like i didn’t have power jump on
also omg i forgot to equip spike shield for that fight too once 😩
@xeno.blade oh wow that’s crazy! Those chapters would be so hard with no badges
@yoshi.c1234 same here!
Hooktail
Gloomtail and Grodus/Bowser every. Damn. Time.💀
I wish they let you equip a badge in battle and lose a turn. Just in case you really need a certain one.
@mintyfriesvr that’s a great idea!!!
First time I played ttyd I found the badge for hooktail but I assumed it was the wrong one since I thought it would be one s h a p e d like a cricket lmao- ended up just beating her without using it at all but when I found out later that I was just having some dumb brain energy,, feels bad man
me when I didn’t have the cricket sfx badge for hooktail
Lmao🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best meme ever

@gg.siren very true. I just hate getting a drum shotgun and then having to jump into peoples boxes, only to hit them for 40 in the head while I get 200 pumped
@guwapogames oh I feel it! I'm sure as I play more zone wars Ill get used to the other maps and start playing them instead.

Look at the likes
nice
Yet the left one was the one who finally won something.
Yet the left one was the one who finally won something.
Sinnoh > Kalos
Imo Kalos Ash should've won the league and Alola ash should've lost
Kalos Ash>Sinnoh Ash But Sinnoh Ash is my second favourite and one of the best. The only two leagues where he really should have won. Especially Kalos
Kalos >>>>>> sinnoh
Ey he won the league, sorry guys.
To me all Ash-es from Kanto to Kalos (Gen 1-6) are all great Ash-es. God this feels weird to say 😂👌

Y’all cool with having the union suit as a shirt he wears out and about? I used to be but idk how to feel since John’s storyline showed us they’re pyjamas. Looks great here tho
@hannah_macintosh I love it personally 😁 I see what you mean but you never get the option for him to wear it without pants so it doesn’t seem weird to me 😊
@youralrightgurrrl true! I think it’s probably supposed to be like an undershirt more than pyjamas now that I think
@hannah_macintosh I agree 😊 it’s definitely a laid back look too. But Arthur doesn’t need a lot to look good.
And they both died
@hannah_macintosh I prefer him in a union suit 😍
@gluten_free_disease It’s very funny in how those two Pinkertons died as well.

Yeeeees
What server
Ya is that a real server it looks like it if not it should be
Yeasssss i will.....
Hapis? 😂😂
Where is oil rig?
Cutting it in the middle and only using the right side would be better
The real question is where is all the monuments?
Вайп полный? Или изучения останутся?
yes
@deni_long
Oil rigs in the Middle East but you can only use it if your base is in America?
Already did on the cosanostra  Earth Apocalypse server. There’s costume monuments with monument puzzles and huge sky scrapers in a city that are all climbable and Ai is spread out in the custom monuments. It’s decent but the map needs work and optimization.
Hell yeah
Yes
Ye im living on england
Cant outpost be central like spain or france
I am now, shit is the best map ever made. A new game of rust.
@_davidcanta yes
Its dope
1000 people must be on the serv
Yes
@yiannideejay is it laggy?
What is the server called and the max pop?
@ie.ez actually it was, I lost an Ak set because I lagged..
Yeah
I'd base right where I live irl that'd be sick
1200-1400 pop I'd play
Hell yea
The server is Amsterdam
this map is very big 100 players miss in the map
@yiannideejay yeah fuck that then lol
Niggas gonna take over a country
i was just playing on the server wtfkk
No

Hey Man I’m Trying To Get Some Feedback On My Recent You Don’t Have To Follow Me Just Want Feedback😌
@brendon.metten I honestly just don’t care enough about them, and as far as I know I have been to every location in the game, just don’t really keep an eye out for them, you literally just get a mediocre crown that you don’t even really keep so fuck the stones of borenzia
@ghosts_of_horror yeah, alright. The extra gems you find are pretty useful though, allows for easy trading.
@brendon.metten its definitely never been my top priority in the game
@ghosts_of_horror not a fan of 100%'ing then?
@brendon.metten I’m a fan of doing what makes me happy, and finding pointless stones that don’t interest me isn’t something I care enough about, as stated
@brendon.metten I put most of my effort into completing the quest lines that fit my build, getting all the daedric artifacts, 100 two handed heavy armor destruction smithing and enchanting and overall just having fun
@ghosts_of_horror hm, that's what I'm doing (different builds/runs) now, but wouldn't you like to have fully done everything in the game before doing that?
@jazmyne.wilsonn at what lvl did u find the last one🤔
@justinimbored or u can just make potions and sell those. U can make 500k in 1h easy
@brendon.metten i was almos lvl 200 when i found my last one. (No mods or internet used)
@atteri104 ._.
@g.f.robbins most likely they just looked the information from google
@atteri104 that’s not as fun as when you’re just doing a quest in a cave or something and just constantly finding gems.
@atteri104 the person who told google
I found all the stones and the crown and let me tell you the increased gem finding chance from pots and chests are an absolute lifesaver especially after getting the Solitude stone for 24000 gold getting the house
@keymemes.exe private meme pages just steal their memes from public meme pages
Don’t even know what these are 💀
@a.lex1232 Google was the first person to find the stones.
I tried doing the quest without help. Got half way through and said f it and went and got the quest marker mod from Nexus.
I got lucky because i actually had a high enough sneak to joke around in game and I was so nooby at the time i picked up everything. I eventually got em all after 3 or 4 days on a play through. After that tho, i just ignore em
Beautiful
Wow👍
I don’t think anyone has lol. If they have then they’re a boss
I did
@jazmyne.wilsonn wow 😱
@gabrielfogger I have and it’s really really worth it. It takes a lot of time but trust me it’s worth it. It’s like almost ever urn has 3 gems at least in it. *comes out of cave with 30 rubies* it’s time well spent you won’t regret it
You’d think it would be like like oh I get a gem every 5 urns, nope it’s at least 3 gems in almost every urn or whatever. Trust me collecting all of them are worth it
I’m at level 103 and only have 14 😞

@reece___bell he's not lying. It's his opinion that it's still garbage. Just because you "disproved" someone doesn't mean his mind must change.
@red_luigs my word lmao
@someweirdo332 I stand with you bro, I agree ☝️ 🔥
People need to stop bashing on it. It's perfectly playable without the microtransactions, especially when you need a time killer/MK on the go without bringing your DS/Switch with you. Sure, it could use a better track selection, and I don't like that it reuses the same ones with minor changes, but then again it just came out. They will add updates eventually and expand it as it goes. And the idea of racing in real parts of the world is actually pretty cool. And at least it isn't just called "Mario Kart Mobile". The missions at the end of the cups are reminiscent of MKDS' mission mode, something that's been absent for over a decade. And the fact that you can add friends this early in is enough for now. Yes, no battle mode or time trials is weird and a boring/bland track selection isn't ideal, but did you really want the next REAL Mario kart on your phone?
@mathewnf477 that's fake
So why does this Mario Kart Tour subscription cost more than my Nintendo Switch Online?
Real gamers don't play mobile games
It's kinda overrated tbh
@stoiicrose smash doesnt deserve to be slandered by a shitty, low-budget, pay-to-win mobile game. I'll just play smash on my switch.
Damn frrrr????
@davidchermanto never said his mind must change. He made a point, I disproved it, therefore since he continued attempting to use that point he was lying about it's validity. He can believe what he wants but the way he communicated it was bad
@reece___bell you didn't disprove anything, you just stated your opinion on microtransactions. There are microtransactions, he didn't like it. Is he lying by saying that he don't like microtransactions? Am I lying by not agreeing with you? What does lying mean for you?
Cmon bruh let’s hook it up with MULTIPLAYER
@parkour_gabriel_man Lmao and what's funny is that I got a lot of characters, karts, and gliders by playing the game and not paying a dime.
who's paying to play? lol
add me 719781735634
I like the game. I wish it had more characters ( luigi😔), and a multiplayer mode. It’s very fun. Stop complaining over the mircotransactions. If you don’t want them, just don’t buy them. It’s not my favorite Mario kart game, but still very fun, and I hope they add new modes and characters.
@oof.cisco Yep, literally there’s no reason for people to complain
(To win against level 1 bots)
@menocksully mario run is littered with required microtransactions and mk tour is littered with optional transactions
@lucas_macbride daily bonus of a couple hundred coins, challenges and racing gets you easily enough within a couple days of playing, you must be fucking about doing nothing to not have enough coins haha, simmer down. Earning coins isn't hard at all if you know what your doing. There's also weekly challenges. If you play the game at all you'd realise there's tens upon tens of ways to make coins and when you level up the store gets fairly large and stocks a lot of stuff. If you have to wait a bit then so what, you don't get given everything you want in a free game
@schiggy_memes no shit
@reece___bell doesn’t mean I have to like the game
@lucas_macbride and yea you could, but that's not the point. Why play pubg on mobile when you could play it on PC? Why play any shooter on console when you could play on PC? There's always a better option, but sometimes it's nice to be given another option that's easier to access. More people have a phone than a DS,switch etc so it's a nice thing to have access too
@someweirdo332 never said you had to like it, just that lying about the game to justify not liking it is a bitch move lmao
@reece___bell the fact that you have to grind out the same 10 courses over multiple days just to get one thing is once again absurd. There’s free to play and pay to win. Also I think you misunderstand, I’m not simmered to begin with. It’s Mario Kart, I have better things to get mad at. I just don’t think this is an acceptable way to monetize the game. It feels gross with how much they’re constantly pushing the surprise mechanics. And again the fact that they allowed duplicates at all is just really sleazy. I’d rather pay an upfront cost for a real Mario Kart than this game.
@reece___bell I’m not lying ?
@someweirdo332 i wasnt talking about you...
@lucas_macbride you don't have to grind out the same course, as I said there's a lot of ways to earn coins. Play each course s couple times to get a good time and score, like other Mario karts, and then move on. The challenges will complete themselves and then the daily bonus on top of that? Plenty coins. And like I said, you can just buy everything you want with coins avoiding dupes. Of course it's there, but you only use it when you have gems. Of course you could buy gems, but there's absolutely no reason too. And again, like i said, of course you could pay up front for another Mario kart. But there's always a better option. But sometimes you don't want a "better" option, you want an accessible one to play with friends. Wondering if you even read my point lmao
@schiggy_memes I know
@someweirdo332 weren't lying but I just disproved all your points? Aye mate sure and I'm descended from the queen
@someweirdo332 oh
@reece___bell I’m wondering if you understand that my problem is with the fact that the game repeats the same 10 tracks. Even if im going through different cups each time im still constantly hitting the same tracks. Which becomes mind-numbingly boring after a while. And you keep insisting that you can get anything from the shop but that’s not true. It’s constantly changing what it offers you and you can be offered duplicates at the shop, wasting spots you could be getting a new racer or part. You can’t even play this game with your friends yet, which feels like it should’ve been the first thing the game launched with. As of right now it’s just a shadow of real Mario Kart and shows off Nintendo’s greed. The better option thing doesn’t even apply here because the game is actively changing itself in a negative way unnecessarily. Pokémon Go made an insane amount of money yet it didn’t have any lootbox system. There are ways to monetize a game without including lootboxes and a grindy shop. This game doesn’t have to be the best Mario Kart experience but it should be an enjoyable one. Which it fails at constantly. Sure it’s great Mario Kart went mobile because everybody has phones but there are ways to make Mario Kart work for mobile without it being a lootbox filled mess. Or even then, by just making the lootboxes cosmetic only, the entire problem goes away.
@lucas_macbride aye right sound mate cba to argue anymore lmao
@schiggy_memes so basically how angry birds added the power ups
@menocksully i guess you can say that, but the microtransactions give you permanant racers, karts, etc. You at least get something useful everytime
@schiggy_memes just gotta love freemium
997709882951 add
Well ive been able to unlock 9 characters without spending a single cent
@uljm_1220 NOOOO an actual Mario Kart game is better than a mobile version? No wayyyy
@someweirdo332 you're probably bad at it lok
People saying Pay-to-Win are just...really? You can easily beat every mission and fully complete it without paying anything
@simarbir_1.24 well yes but also there is way to May micro transactions
@someweirdo332 and? You don't have to pay to fully complete any mission so far
@simarbir_1.24 I’m not the only one who has a issue with them most players do
Nintendo? Thought it was EA.
@simarbir_1.24 he’s more so saying this because it’s a literal downgrade of 7.
@lucas_macbride also costs money and this is made more for casual people
I believe people are calling it shitty because they expect an experience that's extremely similar to a regular console Mario Kart, dude, its a free phone game, it's obviously not going to be the same as a fucking triple A game like Mario Kart on a Nintendo console. (Also the gold pass is completely optional and its only $5, what are you people complaining about)
@simarbir_1.24 Mario Kart 7 does cost money. Correct. And it has functioning controls. There’s changing something to function better for mobile like the lap count, and then there’s removing features from the series and sniping progress for the sake of forcing gross pay to win micro transactions and lootboxes. Casual does not equal fill it with lootboxes.
@someweirdo332 every map is easily completeable with the stuff you're given at the beginning, sounds like youre annoyed at the game because you are either bad at it or can't be bothered to improve and want games to give you stuff for free
@lucas_macbride I disagree with loot boxes, but everything is available in game with some play time, and every map is easy enough to five star with what you are given at the beginning, so you are getting a very decent game for free. Not the best Mario kart by far, but damn if it isn't a good first mobile attempt
@reece___bell not everything is available in game. You can get gems to get a chance to get the items you want. But it’s just a chance and you can get duplicates.
@insecure_burrito I'll give you the controls, they aren't great, but the subscription isn't required at all, all maps are in the base game, every map is easily 5 starred with the stuff given to you at the start of the game, there isn't a paywall as I said it's all available with playtime. It's a well received game there's no doubt about it, not just hyped
@reece___bell oh no I am bad but the fact that game is littered with micro transactions is the reason I don’t like it and if you can’t handle that then to fucking bad
@lucas_macbride alright fair there's one or two karts with the starter pack, but they are no better than the one you are given at the beginning. The "best" karts aren't necessarily the best either, and there's a store where you can just buy the items you want, yea its on rotation but don't act like you can't just buy what you want
@someweirdo332 littered with microtransactions? I mean there's the premium currency fair enough, but that comes with all mobile games unfortunately. Then there's a subscription that gains you nothing in the long run and the items aren't necessarily any better than the stock items. And there's a starter pack where again, there's nothing better than the stock items in it. And you can just buy items you want with coins, admittedly they are on rotation but you still can just wait and buy what you want. And if you can't handle that then to fucking bad 🙃
@reece___bell No you can’t just buy what you want. You need a very high amount of coins to get anything and even then it’s only a few things every day. Oooor you could just buy some gems and spin the wheel to see if you get what you want. The majority of your items are going to come from the pipe. The coin option is nice but I’m not spending hours grinding for the 3,000 coins needed to get Bowser when I could play literally any Mario Kart and he’s unlocked at the start without having to grind the same repeating tracks with atrocious controls.
@reece___bell holy cow you fcking killed him dude
I dont think everyone is gonna play after they gonna make u pay
Its pretty damn fun, Im not really suprised
Add 5611 8912 2427
And the worst lmao. Controls are bad paywall is bad subscription is pricey and S O many people uninstalled. Can’t pretend like it’s good just bc people were hyped
@peachy_paul how the fuck is Mario kart paid to win 🤣🤣 dumbest shit I read all day
@stoiicrose pay for every character
Nice!
@maxmars54 No, but Pokemon Go belongs to The Pokemon Company and Niantic, not Nintendo
@benjaminllauro isn’t Nintendo a majority or at least a shareholder in the Pokémon company?
I love it, but it will be better when you can challange your friends
@maxmars54 I think Nintendo has a percentage of the console games. But for example, they almost didn't get any money from the Detective Pikachu movie
@benjaminllauro Nintendo owns 1/3 of Pokémon.
@uv.lol u not lying tho lol. They would give you Mario and Bowser and the rest are behind a paywall.
@maxmars54 Well, there you go
@peachy_paul You can pay to win if you want, but it is super easy to win without paying anything. Buying stuff is optional
People keep complaining about the micro transactions. Just don’t buy them.
A completely optional subscription that is not forced upon you. And I hope you don't mean that "9.99 a month for online" bs that other pages are posting because all you need is a twitter account to know it's false
@parkour_gabriel_man I feel like it is gonna get worse and worse however my guy, and it is incredibly disappointing to see from Nintendo
@dimitrimois1121 The biggest Nintendo mobile game
@peachy_paul perhaps, but it was a free game in the first place so it makes sense. Kind of like Super Mario Run you have to pay for the other worlds because it was a free game
But in a few weeks its gonna go back down
Anyone can play Mario Kart that’s why
@just_a_friendly_teen 👍
@andrew_dysart
@peachy_paul u r just a noob lol
@kontrastnutte not gonna play it lol
@peachy_paul isn't p2w, i made 1st on every track easily
Deleted it 17 hours later.
Their biggest launch.
But just as shitty as Super Mario RUN
All we need now is a mobile smash
@codpicsfouru I haven’t downloaded any of the Nintendo games, I need context
@kontrastnutte I’m just hoping it won’t be the case for multiplayer
@henry.deester but you have to pay more than the switch online ;-;
You're better off playing Mario Kart 7
Bigger than Super Mario Run?
Big pay to win
@peachy_paul u Just bad that game Is Easy xD
@brick_geysir I dont play it, because it is pay to win
@peachy_paul it's really not only thing gold pass does is unlock 200cc and you get extra gifts that legit it
@peachy_paul n everything you get in the gold pass you could get by grinding so its really not
Too bad it’s garbage
@john_truman stonks
People download this game with more greed than dungeon Keeper who would play this?
Too bad it sucks...
@maxmars54 bruh can you read
@maxmars54 bruh can you read
What do you need the subscription for
Why Nintendo gotta shut down Miitomo tho?
Minecraft earth: ima bout to ruin this whole mans career
Honestly if they didnt lock 200cc behind the paywall and they made the extra rewards like 2 bucks a month, it wouldn't be that bad
And then most of them promptly deleted soon after as did I
Then all almost all of those deleted it after several days
Thats funny since the games ass
@spongy_boi.76 they WHAT?
@just_a_friendly_teen ???
Fun Fact: Mario Kart Tour is called "Tour" because you're ön a World Tour in the game
@gamerlemon extra stuff basically, it gives a two week free trial tho
@john_truman that’s what I’m doing
@just_a_friendly_teen what
Honestly it was complete garbage.
cringe pay to win game though
#mario #mariobrothers #supermario #supermarioworld #luigi #bro #snes #switch #wii #supermarioworld #supermarioodyssey #supermariomaker2 #mariogalaxy #mariokart #facts #gamer #games #videogames #retrogames #classic #boo #supermariobrothers #smash #peach #bowser #supersmashbrothers #yoshi #mariokarttour #nintendo
Get the subscription, collect the rewards and cancel it before the 2 week trial.
@john_truman ends..
Mirco transactions kill the game
This game isn't bad, the free game is fully enough for enjoy it
More than Pokémon go?

@d3vil_child_999 I’ll add you back now
@yung_.spanky I know it’s so dumb I even have some pretty good parts for it to
@209.beto I’ll add you noe
I’ve actually got this and have it recorded lmao 🤣
Yes
@mhhmmm.ryan nice to know dude
@rhett.cowan I have all 3 of the top parts, come in first, and get a frenzy while keeping like a 100 move combo and still don’t get it
@yung_.spanky yeah I’ve only get 10k points on like one or two maps but those are trick maps not normal ones
@yung_.spanky you need like three frenzy's and to hit a ton of player's too. You'd need something like banana frenzy to cause constant damage, or maybe coin frenzy to rack up combo/keep combo between dead zones. It's not really humanly possible without grinding the course for hours
@weirdnickbutok yes, I already mentioned lighting frenzy
@purplecatmaster Ik, I’ve gotten 2 frenzy’s in it and that’s why my high score is like 9.6k rn. But I mean keeping the insanely long combo is hard unless you can predict where they go and drop items before you get to the next set of coins
@purplecatmaster the worst frenzy in the game has to be super horn or banana cannon, super horn just isn’t that good and it’s hard to avoid your own bananas when you shoot out like 40-50 during the frenzy
@yung_.spanky exactly it's insane, and the New York courses give you nothing to work with plus they are the shortest ones
@purplecatmaster I actually just got 5 stars with 1 frenzy but now I’m working on the New York course: I can keep an insanely long combo on it but I don’t have the golden glider and haven’t been getting lucky with frenzies so I can’t pull it off
@yung_.spanky super horn frenzy would be fine if you got it in like 6th so it actually hit people, but at best it might kill a few bananas or side steppers because you can only get it in like 1st-3rd. Also i would say green shell is worse than banana cannon, since green shells would almost all be wasted but the star power during frenzy makes you maybe kill 5 of your own bananas but you don't have to take any crashes
@purplecatmaster I would agree but if it’s a closed in track than it works a lot better, especially triple green shell frenzy in a closed in track because they bounce every where
@yung_.spanky RNGesus be praised
@purplecatmaster I don’t mind rng because it’s kinda the whole gimmick in Mario kart besides steering but the game requiring you to have good rng is bs
Yo. Check out our Mario kart video on our page !!
No, I’m glad I didn’t because I would have restarted the race over😭😭☠️
We all know banana frenzy is the scariest
I got a bowser shell frenzy once
WAIT IS THIS REAL
@unggabungga it's not bots, it's ghosts of past plays
@lyle.lo wait but there’s collision
@lyle.lo i would understand if there was no collision, but there is, so it isn’t possible for it to be past players bc if they followed the same inputs then they would be driving into walls and i wouldn’t be getting 8th place every match
@lyle.lo they take the names of real players and their real setups but they are just bots controlling the duplicate accounts, sometimes you will find one person’s username twice in one match (both with the same setup) but one will be in first and the other will be in 7th place (bc i will be in 8th)

@d3vil_child_999 i need to be added for the challenges
@ozzygraphy i recently got bowser shell frenzy and thunder frenzy i racked up 11k from a race
The frenzy to end friendships. Please just dont make this a thing on multiplayer @nintendo
If I did I would delete the game
Not yet thank god
Bowser shell frenzy>>>>>
@purplecatmaster Donkey Kong Banana frenzy Is terrifying
@adumb825 sounds like something someone without bowser would say
@alonsos_spam I have him, I mean it's great to use but it's so broken
I will murder whoever i see using even a regular blue shell
Some say it’s stronger than the strongest nuke in the world
Bowser shell frenzy is worse
@purplecatmaster lightning frenzy?
i once got a lightning frenzy.
Lol I hit people with a mega mushroom and a bowser shell frenzy if that counts
Best frenzy is triple red shell frenzy
No
No
@i_have_no_life1552 I literally just got it an almost got a 9k score
I just got the bowser shell frenzy almost got 9k score ..
@purplecatmaster red shell and bowser frenzy’s can be the most clutch and yet also the most cursed of the frenzy’s
@yung_.spanky holy fuck that exists
😱
literally ur against bots for right now, and it isn’t possible for the bots to get frenzies, so in short, no, i haven’t gotten hit by the blue shell frenzie
I have gotten this and I was like wtf
Nope not once
Add me on mario kart 697941862821
Wait but if yout the person in front cuz you got there after getting this does it hit you?!
My friend: The Movie isn’t that scary.
The movie:
That #joyconboys tag hurts me
@gewoonarra same
@rathstink coin frenzy am i a Joke to you
yeah but they don’t even home they’re just bombs
@ethantaehong.tv ya, I got it on that bullshit metal Mario level in the last cup and somehow still can’t get 10k
@1globalluna it blows up second place and people behind u. it's p fun ngl.
What happens if you get a bulletbill frenzy?
I literally had that in my game, now I know how it feels to chew 5 gum
I got this twice in a race
I feel like lucky 7 frenzy is a thing. Please tell me it isnt
I got every frenzy except blue shell😮
@1globalluna he cappin bro
This is a cursed image
I once got this frenzy
blooper frenzy is best for points
Player in first place is about to get a heart attack.
3454 9494 8078
@ravian.w at least you get a shit ton of points from the coins AND the frenzy
I used it and its just bad and weakest. Bullet bill frenzy is better
THAT EXISTS?!?
Need to relax? Then check out my hand press videos.
Imagine bullet bill frenzy
@jacqueebofficial blooper is better, it's around 50 points per hit and can hit mayhe like 6 times
NOOO
Not yoshi😂
I had this with bowser shells 0.o
I remember getting that, I felt like god for 10 seconds
Wait so wat if u go to first place while h have it
@karoax_r SAMEEE I was a fucking god that round
Oh god oh fuck I thought this was fake at first
I didn’t know bullet bill was in the game
I thought red shell frenzy was bad enough
Bomb frenzy is lit
i remember getting coin frenzy lol
That is scary.. My favourite tho is bomb frenzy... I feel like a real demoman... THEY'RE GONNA BURY WHAT'S LEFT OF YA IN A SOUP CAN!
My worst enemy has just gotten buffed
@purplecatmaster shrooms frenzy
@rhys_not_reese not that good, maybe a toad triple shroom frenzy though
It'll be bad of me if I don't share this testimony to go @investor_stanley_crypto changed my life I'm recommending @investor_stanley_crypto to any one who wants to trade Bitcoin/Forex.
@markussking f, I’m level 19
Bowser shell frenzy is the worst
No the most deadly is Pauline her and the lucky seven will leave some people will be scared for life
Tell me this isn't real
@mountain_drew10 mushroom and coins are best for farming
but what about  l u c k y  7  f r e n z y
@purplecatmaster I’d say blooper frenzy is best for getting points tho
im not liking cuz it says liked by smashdom and 666 others
Ive gotten this frenzy like twice so far it doesnt really feel that empowering
@yung_.spanky I’m level 11
@tallestpix is that a thing?
Haven’t encountered this one. Red shell frenzy is op when you’re in last place
@ozzygraphy yeah coz if you think about it frenzy is just infinite tricks, infinite items of the ones you matched and invincibility for a period of time
@sa_v___ it’s real...
Also lightning frenzy, bullet bill frenzy, bowser shell frenzy, double bomb frenzy and banana barrel frenzy.
@tallestpix real
@tallestpix I've had multiple
@tallestpix That's 100% real. I got it multiple times and it's pretty deadly. 😂
Imagine how much suffered the one that was first
Add me: 5573 5573 7269
Parry this,you fucking casual
Lightning frenzy op
@tallestpix holy smokes, haven’t had that one or faced anyone with it
@yung_.spanky coin frenzy busted for points
It's like the weakest frenzy, Bullet Bill Frenzy exists, Bowser Shell Frenzy Exists, Red Shell Frenzy Exists, and they are all way scarier
Oh god oh fuck
@purplecatmaster bowser shell frenzy haunts me
@purplecatmaster tf bro, lighting frenzy has got to be the scariest shit in the game
I like the lightning and bomb frenzy they’re a bit to overpowered
Lightning is op, blooper is op but just for point farming, but bowser shell frenzy is what keeps me up at night
@yung_.spanky true, that's probably the most powerful one
oh god...

Very nice, sharing the Nintendo love!
@freeradicaldave Who are we kidding, I can't possibly play all of these, especially not all at once! 😅
Every time I see Nintendo Land, I think of how Nintendo should sell those mini games separately on the Eshop. I’d gladly pay $9.99 to have Donkey Kong Crash Course or Metroid Blast on Switch.
Yeah, dude, that’s a great haul! I actually collect for both Wii and WiiU, so this looks like a goldmine to me!
@bryansaturn Nice, I would've never known! 😂 But yea, there's clearly alot of ppl dumping their collections so there's lots of pickings to be had.
@blastprocessed I played Nintendoland at launch and it impressed me. If I had the disposable income I would've probably bought one on the spot.

@boodgy
Onto pull dominance, this ability allows you to pull enemies straight to your feet really good against runners like Maul and Palps. It’s not like Kylo’s tho so you gotta be planted on the ground to use it. And finally retribution, being the second best ability in large scale modes able to clear rooms of infantry no problem, BUT it can either go good or fucking terrible. The amount of times you activate this and the people outside the radius just melts you and you die almost instantly when out of retribution is crazy. It’s one of those abilities where you gotta be careful when to use it at times. Anakin is an absolute beast in the game.

@nash.perez54 YES

@professor.baeleth goose truly is the god we've been waiting for
I haven't checked twitter in 3 years😂
@emblem.birb_ Going to max out the credit card for a +10 Goose

Tbh Dimitri imitation was shit
Claude gets me everytime whenever he says "my ancestors were cursed therefore I'm cursed"

Curious fact= the Japanese VA don't imitate the voice of the people they are talking about. So this is just an idea of the English VA. Yeah they're amazing
OP forgot Claude's "daddy!"
I love these kids.
Why does Claude sound like Pinnochio from Shrek?
@g.c_sandwich wait, no, it was GINGY
love how the fe community saw untitled goode game and went “MY CHILD NOW”
Uh. I kind of don’t get the goose meme

@giffarie.ownie halo kakak hypebeast 😁👍
Gila sih di Akihabara. Ada toko apa gitu namanya yang jual buku sama CD second, dan itu bisa bikin aku khilaf banyak 😂
@paplapapla wah bisa pingsan sangkin bahagianya😂, bayangin, game masa kecil pun ada, malah kayaknya rilisan baru sega genesis, yang paling berkesan kemaren gigs VK, asli kereeen x ! lebih keren dari yang diliat di yutub malah, tapi no foto, no video, begitulah tertibnya orang Jepang, bandnya semua bagus, terutama Jiluka 'n Deviloof😁
@alteredjoy yahhh aku malah gak nonton gigs disana. Kenapa gak kepikiran ya 😭😭
@paplapapla next ada anniversary gazette bulan Maret, kmaren mau nonton Diru di Kyoto, ternyata tgl 14nya khusus buat member a [knot], tgl 15nya baru buat umum, memang kurang friendly sama gaijin band Jepang, jadi musti pinter2 cari tau, berhubung tgl 15 uda harus di Tokyo, ya batal, hahaha, next time wajiblah,  tujuan awal Gazette pun ga jadi juga, padahal harga tiketnya ga mahal buat event gede 😁
@alteredjoy iya, agak ribet emang ya klo nonton di Jepang. Aku kmaren niatnya cuma muterin Tokyo aja sama makan. Mungkin next time akan niat nonton Diru kalau memang mereka gak bikin-bikin juga Asia Tour.
@paplapapla itu yang Dexcore di Shinjuku antiknock pun sebenarnya ga bisa beli tiket pake CC luar Jepang, sekitar 400-500 ribuan aja, solusinya begitu nyampe Tokyo kita datengin tuh ke sana, jumpain yang kelola tempat, gabisa bahasa Inggris tapi niat x kasi informasi, dia kasi solusi malah, pake google translate kita komunikasi, ada foto2 sama personelnya lagi, asli ramah, mau fotoan kalo yang udah make up, hahaha, yang belum make up rata2 maskeran sambil loading gear, personelnya malah juga ikutan angkat barang, hahaha, ada fotoan sama si Ray, gitarisnya Deviloof, yg pake gitar 7 senar🤣, langsung mau dia diajak foto, wkakakak !
@alteredjoy bandnya ramah banget !!! 😆orang sana tuh gitu ya. Keliatan gak pedulian sama orang lain, tapi kalau udah ngobrol bisa akrab. Tapi itu, terbatas di bahasa 😭😭 Kamu masih disana atau sudah pulang ??
@paplapapla hahaha, iya bener 😁👍, udah pulang, tgl 19 kmaren pulangnya, wajibla ntar ke Jepang lagi, banyak lagi yang belum di explore di Tokyo 'n Kyoto, ke pusat merchandise, aksesoris sama cd band j-rock juga surga bener, ada closet child mens, like an edison, dll, harganya jauh lebih murah daripada beli di Tower Records, hahaha, dijamin ga bisa tahanlah kalo ga belanja, temen sampe borong cd sama vhs x-japan, di Shinjuku tuh pusatnya, tempat jumpa fans dan fotoan sama band2 indie vk juga, pake semacam tiket juga tuh, luar biasa😂
@alteredjoy soal belanja, surga banget emang 😂 parah !! Datang bawa koper kosong, pulang malah nambah koper 🤣🤣
@paplapapla photobook nightmare cuma 1000 yen, beratnya 2 kilo ada kayaknya, 🤣, kalung deathgaze official kolaborasi desainer, cardigan AMEN rad market, kaos blackmoral Gazette, yang NINTH world tour malah, masih ada tag nya lagi, cd gazette NINTH sama FED sekenan, majalah Stuppy, Shoxx, Arena 37°C, dll yang edisi lama juga masih dijual, masih baru, 700 yen an aja, hahaha, mau dipost juga ga banyak yg ngerti betapa harta karunnya barang2 begini buat yang suka, harganya mahal2 bener soalnya beli online kan?
@alteredjoy gilak sih itu banyak banget hartanya !!! Iya, harganya murah makanya bikin khilaf 😂 Aku sih kangen suasananya, visual kota modern yang nyampur sama tradisional, kebersihannya, bisa jalan kaki kemana-mana, toilet umumnya, disiplinnya, sama satu lagi COWOK COWOKNYA 😂
@paplapapla 😂, kalo kita cowok semua, jadi banyak fotoan sama cewek yg cosplayan di TGS plus Akihabara, sangat ramah dan terbuka sama orang asing, asal izin dulu kalo mau fotoan🤣
@alteredjoy memory hape sama kamera kamu pasti auto jadi full pas pulang ya 😂😂 Aku kemaren kenalan sama orang sana di pesawat. Next klo kesana lagi, ada tempat utk mengadu. Wkwkwk ~
@paplapapla malah ga begitu banyak fotoan, foto kuil, tempat2 wajib, sama sudut2 kota aja paling, sangkin fokus sama banyaknya hal2 menarik, hahaha, ya ga apa apa, mumpung di sono kenalan aja sebanyak2nya, kita biasanya kenalan awalnya dari api rokok, kalo lagi jalan, atau kebetulan satu tempat nginep😁
@alteredjoy nginep di daerah mana aja kmaren ?
@paplapapla Osaka Namba, Kyoto di Kyoto Guesthouse, apartemen deket Kyoto station, Tokyo ada dua tempat, yg satu lupa karena sehari aja, yang terakhir yang lama daerah Ueno, hostel waq waq
Yah , hentai and jav too
credit yang moto koq gk di mention :(

Nice shots !
Minecraft Earth looks like a Sims mod
House of the Dead was awesome on Dreamcast
@didyouknowgamingfacts Pokémon go really thrives in my area because it’s a community thing. Going to raids and doing things together is the fun part. Hanging out with people with the same interests. Idk much about Minecraft earth, but it will need to have a strong backbone like Pokémon did for such a bold release of a mobile game.
@didyouknowgamingfacts no
House of the Dead in my opinion is the best shooter at an arcade and it still holds up. It’s always so cheap to play and I could sit/stand there buying more lives
Who cares about apex btw
Let me guess crypto finna be pansexual
Omg house of the dead ♥️😂
@yousef.af19 telit soura, hay lgame lkenna 3am nehke 3anna eza manne gholtan

Minecraft and The House Of The Dead🔥
@brasilmeltdown check out house of the dead brody
Bro, House of the Dead is my shit.
@jameskclarke Oh shiittt
@_prince_mocha no way man. That’s what you were telling me about but damn
hoooly thotd being remade? i can't wait!
@stonyjuankanobi rrrrrrrrrrrrr
im more excited for house of the dead more than anything 💀
@eewvan79 hell yeah I am! I’m totally going!
Omgomgomg house of the dead remake 😍
@didyouknowgamingfacts no
I so hope the house of the dead remakes have horrible voice acting again. That was almost the best part
Damn i remember the house of the dead game mode in sega superstar tennis
House of the dead remake...👌🏾🔥
@didyouknowgamingfacts No , coz it won't be free
Call of Duty Mobile willl also release on October 1st 🤷🏼‍♂️
How is house of the dead gunna be remade into a resident evil type game?
@ultimasanctus Lisa! *But actually says it in monotone*
I miss shooting the gun of screen just to hear the announcer say Relo Relo Re Re Re Reloaf
@melovesmotu it will be free😂
@bio_brot Minecraft and free? 😂 woohoo
What is minecraft earth, I assume it’s like Pokémon go except you build something and others can look at it?
Minecraft earth is already out for early access? Or is it different
HoTD getting remakes is pretty lit ngl
@didyouknowgamingfacts Yes, and I'm hyped as hell for S3
HOTD was one of my fav Wii games probably my first zombie game tbh
@crimson_fukr same here
@didyouknowgamingfacts Yeah I think it’s different enough too and has content that will allow people to play for a while.
What's Minecraft Earth and how have I not heard of it
House of the dead is so fun
@christina.l.nemeth excited?!?
Cool
House of the dead was scary :,(
@didyouknowgamingfacts No
@didyouknowgamingfacts i tried it, it sucks
@didyouknowgamingfacts yupp
@didyouknowgamingfacts no
@didyouknowgamingfacts no
I cant say I was ever a fan of house of the dead cause i’m not that big on railshooter games. I know its an arcade game and everything but because of the game design, it’s very unimmersive and doesnt make it too enjoyable for me. Though I will admit I like to better my odds with games like that and dual wield pistols 👌🏻
@christina.l.nemeth excited?!?
I need that House of the Dead
House of the dead?! I NEVER would have seen that coming
Isnt this an arcade game ? I didn't know it was an actual video game on a console
@grazioso589 vr Minecraft
@grazioso589 it's AR not VR. Basically take Minecraft to the real world and you can create and build things through your phones camera to whatever you're looking at, as well as fight mobs and what not
Sega is actually using IPS that aren’t sonic or yazuka? Never thought I’d see the day.
@didyouknowgamingfacts no I really dont think it will
Hyped for apex
Do you still play Apex Legends?
Do you think Minecraft Earth will be the next Pokémon Go?
@sheremydiaz
Wow
LETS GO HOUSE OF THE DEAD, that shit was the #1 go to game every time I’m in the arcade
Can’t wait to see gigantic penises and swastikas everywhere
House of the dead for switch?
Yes apex!
@didyouknowgamingfacts hell yes!
I REMEMBER SEEING THAT GAME IN THE ARCADE WHEN I WAS LIKE 6
Lit
👀
Back when Star Wars games were actually good.
Please check out my Anime & Manga drawings! 💕 I know you'll like it ;)

@vg_kyle is that even possible 🤷🏽‍♂️😂

Baixei a demo pra ver se tinha algo diferente, se tirar o modo volta vira o fifa 17.
@gamesdecasa Verdade. Não sei se o modo Volta é suficiente para dizer que o jogo é novo...
@brgeeky Cara... Tem elenco que em 10 dias já tem só jogador top! Só no FIFA coin!!!

Nice deflect 👌🏻 and it pains me seeing a highlander trying to use a light in response to an unblockable
Please excuse my ignorance but what is an option select
@ms.execution Yeah, he had been doing it the whole match, and then when I parried him, he called me sweaty 😂😭 I just can't win
@stinky_glad if he called you sweaty for that then he doesn't deserve to plat highlander PERIOD
@uncle.lx Ahh, it's a move that counters a 50/50. Take Glad's skewer for example. He was throwing lights because the light would either A. Cancel my skewer or B. Hit me when I tried to feint into GB. It's basically a cheap tatic to avoid a 50/50
I’ve seen sweatier from lower reps lmao
@stinky_glad kinda like back step light hl kick?
@uncle.lx Kinda! And tbh, option selecting is super sweaty 😂 Yet here he is messaging me asking why I'M sweaty
You’re the only glad I like, take that as a ginormous compliment. For your ilk are horrible.
@yoshi.committed.tax.fraud Well, thank you 😂
Bruh, that highlander kills was clean. TEACH ME THE WAYS OF GLAD!
Glad it's not to bad to go up against, he is quite fun in fact, it's just that I wish that his heavys has standard gb vulnerability, that's 0 vulnerability bullshit it's so frustrating at times
Theyre just mad lul
Your enemies are actually so shit lmao
@vladmoticica Would you believe me if I said this is how 99% of Xbox players play? 😂
Yes
Bro that BP makes all us BP mains look bad 🤦‍♂️ he coulda at least tried to have use feints or something smh
@logan_f_santos Yeah 😂 A LOT of BP play like that

@nintendofire additional soundtrack.
@indigo_dancing_duelist Ohhh okay I'll try to find it, thank you very much ❤️
@nintendofire good luck... the point of the ast is that its not official so you’re not really gonna find a source
@indigo_dancing_duelist Really?? So did these guys just dig it up from the game files? I'll search around since it's a shame this wasnt included in the game:/
Nice play! 😄
@the_destroyer_pc 🙏🤘🤘🤘
If only you played like that when we game 😫
@overdosedgaming lol right 😂
🔥🔥🔥
Wow this is really amazing, I like how you showed your history to DDS. Great stuff🤘
@hadielhajj02 Thanks! 😊 Well, for my a game is like a book, record or movie. Those things mean a lot to me because of the history I have with them. I fed off from them and I wave them into the history of my life.
@ludotheke Massive respect👊
@hadielhajj02 for me a game is not a collector's item. They are things to enjoy, play and live in. I read somewhere that a game is where dreams and reality meet. 😊
@ludotheke that is very true, according to my experience
@ludotheke that is very true, according to my experience
I absolutely loved Nocturne, it was amazing and the first shin megami game I had played. Not one of my friends could understand its appeal
@dadgymnerd I still have a hard time describing it to friends too. I wish I had more time to do another play through. Maybe as a build up to SMT5 we'll get a port on the Switch. That'd be sweet. 
The version with Raidou of course. 😅
Just bought dds1 and have been playing it while I'm not that far in it yet  really enjoying the difference with this and the mantra tree system as well
@nezz96_ Yeah. I like it that it's similar to the Sphere System from FFX. That definitely ease me in!😅
@ludotheke yes man so simple yet effective love games that let me build
@fear_vcappo @fear_v2savage 😂😂
@fear_vlag the kid in the hoodie reminded me of u no cap

Missingno!
I think it is the return if Kryppuk and not a Galar Pokemon
Willows found his child porn
It’s Gallade hentai
Missingno
It's definitely GiratinaxY/N fanfiction
@bethmoth hello bethmoth
@bethmoth Yes, I've been in contact with one of the devs!
@brendan.spookboy Thank you for your support (:
Ho...ly....shit
@birds.right.activist Are you okay?!
@raylessblade yeah bruv, shit's just so fire 🔥🔥 love the attacking phase you've got here, I can imagine the potential it has in bigger scale battles already! You guys are killin' it 👏👏👏
@birds.right.activist Thank you so much! (: We're open to any and all suggestions/ideas you might have
@raylessblade definitely strive for more variety in combat! How you had that 3x3 grid system alongside the "undertale-esque system will keep it fresh, especially with the different enemies you have planned. It makes battles almost like mini games all with their own variety. I could see a "guitar hero" sort of game with attacks coming from the top down and having to quickly side step to the left and right to dodge whatever attack. It reminds me of rhythm games, especially the game "Thumper." I'd look into games like that for inspiration if you plan on expanding upon your battle system
@birds.right.activist Omg that's actually a really good idea. We're definitely planning on expanding upon it. We didn't even feature any of the player's abilities/spells which will probably be the main feature of the combat. Just using the sword on the enemy is so boring! Thanks for your input
@raylessblade you should definitely try to broaden your groups. I saw your comment about being in contact with one of the Revinite devs (I'm hoping I can get accepted into the team for art and possibly writing) and it definitely helps to have connections. You could always end up becoming good partners with other teams like them and the devs for that Kingdoms of the Dump game and find more inspiration and assets. Maybe easter eggs from their games could make their way into yours and vice versa!
@birds.right.activist Yes definitely, you do art? I saw kingdoms of dumps, that game looks amazing. We're just hoping to have a successful kickstarter so any feedback you have, like right now, is super highly extremely fantastically absolutely invaluable to us (:
@raylessblade I've been doing art for a long while, yes! Although it's more of a hobby I hope to make it at least somewhat profitable in the future, even with the couple of commissions and art gifts I've made. If you're interested I do have some "inktober" pieces from last year (though you'd have to scroll through a little bit, I post a decent amount, plus I only got to do a few days of inktober for various reasons). During my "application" for the dev team for Revenite I had to send in some of my work, so I'm hoping all goes well
@birds.right.activist We would definitely be interested in seeing your work (:
Yes I love the Undertale elements in your battle mechs 💯💯 🖖🏾🤓
Woahhhh, just found this and it looks amazing!!!
@nstramental Thank you so much!
@_alexander_personal_ Thank you, Alexander! (:
@raylessblade anytime fam, you and your team should keep grinding towards your goals no matter what anybody says 🖖🏾you got this🤓
Is that a power up, when you switch into the dot mode? That’s dope
@bopious It is the shield mode! It's the function of the player's shield and every shield will grant the player different abilities while in shield mode!
Looking good!
Can't wait to see the end result of this game my guy :D
@bethmoth Thank you so much! :D
This definitely has some reminiscence of the undertale battle system. I’m very excited to play once this is out, lookin good dude
@raylessblade totally man! Gotta support them indie games my guy! Me and some other dudes are working on that game @revenitegame I think you might have heard of it? Either this games lookin super Rad

It definitely sounds very Last Of Us. I really like it though.
This is dope 🔥
@liatherr they lied and said that you can’t play as Ellie in the first game but you were able to.
What husband would give up on his wife like like that. like the fuck

I can relate, my parents have done this to me so many times 😂
Once my Dad did that and I legit thought he forgot my age eek

@unsealedgames If my life ever goes back to total normalcy, you will see everything. Mark my words. Plus I'll get back into collecting more 😍👍😂
@daneofurexistence the thought of those stacked boxes soothes the pain
@zengamer I'm glad they do for you. All I think about is negative. 😥
@daneofurexistence 😩
@zengamer My whole life is in there 😃😣
@unsealedgames 🤣
🤣🤣🤣......no need to strain bro. You made the right decision.
Damn , I completely missed out on this Nintendo stacky thingy
Pathetic stack👎🏻
Least if they fall takes only a few seconds to restack , your thinking outside the box 🤘🤘
I only have 1 Physical game in my collection but have like 170 digital games I only have a 128GB SD card so I have the games I play on them some games were free from various sites for posts
@gameralley The Switch is a really good digital system
@polybits_ I'm glad 😂
@retroyanx But did you? Really? 😂
@joey.jo.jo.junior.shabadoo I suck and I'm not a true gamer
@beadyeye82 PRECISELY 😂
@daneofurexistence I really want to beef up my Physical Collection too I’ve been loving DC .Universe lately
@gameralley Physical is always good 👍
@daneofurexistence not even qualified as a fake gamer
@joey.jo.jo.junior.shabadoo I know 😣
That makes my OCD happy🤤
@zengamer Haha good! But what about THIS? *puts a handful of forks where spoons go*
All I hear are a buncha lousy exuses! I wanna see them... NOW! 😂🤣😂
@unsealedgames Ok 😒 *starts driving*

Dammit! Why wasn’t I notified of the higher offer? 😩
@sheemstar that’s lame
@retro_drag0n_claims stupid Instagram
Nice collection bro
@the_chronicles_of_a_gamer thanks!
Oh my gosh I love Robo Kid, it doesn't make any sense to me but the art style is amazing
@princeofbrains that's a UPL game for you.
Beautiful 😍😍
@bl85gamer gratze!
@therealdire51 🙏🙏 you killed it this week 💪🏼💪🏼
@bl85gamer thanks! Had to, it's shooters we're talking about here.🗿
@therealdire51 Did you ever read Console Wars? There's a part where a Sega of America executive sarcastically mentions Robo Kid as an example of why nobody knows who Sega is and it seems hurtful 😂
@princeofbrains no, I haven't yet - and geez, way to kick the little guy. That's like someone saying that nobody knew the NES because of Chubby Cherub.
Plenty of solid shooters in there 👍🏻. You’ve been a machine this week pumping out the shooter posts 🤘. I can only manage one a day and spend rest of my time putting up everyone else’s posts in Story 😂  Been awesome having you join and contribute to the cause
@turbothunder16 every so often, inspiration strikes. This week, I was really feeling inspired. Thanks! 😁

Wym by for once
it's skimming
This how u read when u got a test next period that u didnt study for
nigga reads right to left
@guccinotebook I was jus boutta say that💀
It’s actually possible to do this
To read that fast you would need 400 iq (your brain capacity of understanding and foreseeing info) so no i can assure you he does not read that fast
it’s wally west
@majin_byoki he’s reading Braille my dude
This is the best video on the internet😂👌
@datoneweeb then he truly does have 400 iq 0_0
@guccinotebook arabic niggas
I read fast, people who cant read fast are the lesser beings.
I think the guy is blind
@majin_byoki dont know who the told you that but there are people who can read that fast
@guccinotebook arabs read like that
When the book report is due in 5 minutes
It’s how I read my summer reading for school
He’s probably on acid feeling the textures of the letters pop up out of the page, fr 🤣🤣

@gamesftwofficial Best COD since ps3 in my opinion
@tyler.kollar I had that same feeling till they announced that they will have supply drops and all that shit again with weapons you can get from the drops so basically another p2w 🙄
I like turtles...
CoD should be dead by now tbh.
It was awesome! Can't wait for the full game to come out. Only thing I hate is survival coming out a year later on xbox/pc...
@halil_ganiev whelp it's still one of the world's most popular gaming franchises
@never.again.pi just like MW2
@zombie_king_nv oh yeah definitely survival mode 🔥now that’s going to be fun
I thought that xbox got 2 weekend's for the beta but we didnt
@bananachipblog que les pareció AD ASTRA? Tenemos opiniones divididas con mi esposo @mlmiguel 😂🙈
@iselmarie84 es buena pero, no excelente. La fotografía es de las mejores (en cuanto a películas de ciencia ficción) pero, tiene demasiados momentos que "se la bajan a uno" y no tiene un final que te de esa como sensación de alivio y/o satisfacción
@bananachipblog estamos en sintonía! Igual creo que @mlmiguel concuerda en lo que mencionan... lo que le llamó la atención a el es lo "fucked up" que está el personaje que interpreta Brad Pitt, el le gusta lo complejo de ese tipo de personajes 🙄
@iselmarie84 el personaje de Brad Pitt tiene demasiados daddy issues hahaha
@bananachipblog Y va hasta Neptuno para resolverlos 😂
@iselmarie84 😂😂😂
@bananachipblog han hecho ustedes alguna lista de las mejores películas sobre el espacio??
@mlmiguel no pero, lo tomaremos en cuenta, ¡qué super idea!😮🚀

What Shotgun is that?
I can only find one shotgun in this game...
M30 better easily my favorite gun in the whole game after the Enfield
Shotguns super nooby
Please , Don’t play this shit ,, go back to BF1
@rafat_baharovic I hate shotguns. Somehow they are worse in BF1 other than the times I get sniped by a m30 drilling
Shotgun noob
🙏🏾🙌🏾
@i94_ty let’s go 💪🏾
@wisegotgame let me know I’m ready
👏👏❤️👏
i love this game 😍😍 !!!
Love it❤️❤️
Omg🔥
Bro why does he look like he's playing a whole different game
Any tips im just getting into AT monsters and am getting my ass kicked, anyone have any dual blade builds?
Hell yes 😍🔥👏
Good good good👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻
@noran_rynam DB are focused on elemental damage in HR most of the sets revolves around ATKT weapons (Kulve Taroth) but in master tank I’m not sure which are best but the set is four piece silver rath for late game and Garuga greaves the Garuga greaves are best in game without a doubt
Is this fight much different to the one in the story mission?
@noahaonrobinson i can’t speak with technical accuracy but it certainly feels scaled up in its aggression, HP and how much damage it does. The first fight is a good indication of what to expect though.
Would you say it’s harder than AT nerg?
@definitely_deviljho lol if you mean comparatively, fighting AT Nerg when it came out vs Ruiner In Iceborne, then no, AT was a far greater challenge. This is comparable to Nerg in vanilla. Maybe a little harder.
What’s the armor you have in the video?
@xenoswarm then I don’t see it being super different from the AT nerg attacks and shtuff
@noahaonrobinson nah AT Nerg is completely different. It’s attacks are far more punishing and it’s damage and HP are crazily increased. This isn’t that hard.
@z.nezuko I’ll probably post my build later
@z.nezuko but it’s Meta teo, Brute Tigrex chest and yah Garuga legs
@xenoswarm alright
Can you share your build!
@xenoswarm oh well then I guess I can farm it easier
@j_shxnks I agree. MR armor there isn’t really a best of the best like KT sets. It’s really about your play style with MR armor and the skills that suit what you plan to do. Myself. I’m running Banbaro armor all quests. Idc what anyone says 😂😂
Got youtube?
Wait wtf it can bleed you?! I'm sorry but haven't reach nergi yet
😍😍😘
@mohamad_akmal__ yeah lol, bring plenty of Astera Jerky
@schemer.sensei 🖤💖
@xenoswarm hell yeah..nergi my fav in the base game. Can't wait to fight ruiner 👏
@xenoswarm , you play a lot with this LS, I'm still at that skill level, and your good video editing is great, congratulations 👏👏
That's Leviathan, by the Monuments!
💚💚💚
Beautiful 🗡
@xenoswarm ❤️❤️ love this . Can you share your build? Please 😁
This was both mesmerizing and horrifying to watch because I felt so bad for that Nergi 💀🤣
😎👌
How do you take so little damage?
How do you take so little damage?
@bbreakkfastt all the damage you see me take in this video is during a counter. Counters mitigate most of the damage but you will still take on status effects. That’s why I don’t get knocked down but still suffer Bleeding.
You do it to me😂
You do it to me😂
@seth_hates_yellow because your gonna have to sit there for the longest time because there’s nothing you can do about it. To me it’s scummy and it shows how salty a killer is that they have to do that to someone.

I've currently just finished the 2nd dungeon and I totally agree - I'm going to be so sad when it ends as the world has just totally pulled me in. Let's hope Nintendo follow up with a remake of Link to the past 😁😁😁
@gamer.unicorn09 thank you girly! 💕 Have fun with the game!
@nintendoplaystation thank you my friend! Glad you enjoyed it too 😄
@10eestudio it’s amazing! I wish I played it slower 😂
@meep_games Hero mode! 💗😉
I’m going to 100% it too but idk if I’ll use a guide because I’m doing pretty well so far ☺️ I’m on the 6th dungeon right now
Such a cute and amazing game 😍 Loved every minute of it 😊
Oooo so fast! 😆 Well done on completing!!! 🙌🏼
It’s an absolutely beautiful tale! 🍃💚 Such an iconic adventure for sure!
Oh awesome!!!! 😍😍I love this game ao much! I never played the original so it was completely new to me and I immediately fell in love 💖
I love links awakening 😫🙏🏻 I want a port from the wind waker that would be awesome 😍 beautiful picture girl 💗
Last month I finished the old version, now I’m trying this new wonderful version, thanks nintendo lol
I just started it but I love it 😍 Nice graphic design and lovely Charakters 😍
Beautiful photo! ❤️🔥
Please 😍
It's awesome it's so cute and catches nostalgic and modern gaming into a awesome remake. 😄💕
I love it a lot, I haven't finished it yet though
I saw you playing this over the weekend! Im working my way through it. But I had to open a guide for some parts already, I'm terrible with the dungoens.
Oh wow you never put it down i seee hahaha I’m glad you enjoyed it💚💚💚💚
Can i becom the Links awakening
I'm really enjoying the game so much! I'm hoping to complete it by the end if this week! Beautiful shot as always girly 💕💕💕
Love this game so much! ☺️💗 Taking my time!
Niceeeeeeee 👊😊
I love this game it was amazing I might go back and 100% it too lovely shot 😊

@rodolfo.araneda
@jaimethegamerprojxn01 I like that about the track. C:
@cocobandicootuwu true that, the portals are a neat idea
Whatevs Now That Season 3 Is Done, I Can’t Wait For Season 4.
😉👍
@marioandsonicfan_768  Agreed! :D
@cocobandicootuwu ;)
I only wanted to set Spyro .. didn’t really like the new coco and crunch skins .. I can’t wait to see the Nitro girls again .. when you think they’ll be back ?!
@p21_des Yea and please don’t ask me questions about the trophy girls and such. I honestly don’t know when they’ll be back. I only know just as much as you guys do. But I think they’ll most likely come back after all the future Grandprixs are over.
@cocobandicootuwu sorry for bothering you ❤️
I unlocked crunch!
@megablinder7 same
@megablinder7 Me too C:
@p21_des It’s okay C:
Spyro should have got a legendary skin. i doubt i will complete another grand prix. spyro was the exception.
When the next one coming?
I loved this GP, but I got in the top 5% but I still dont have the Champion Kart.
@bossgamerproductions We’ll most likely get it on the day when the October Grandprix starts.
@cocobandicootuwu Ahh, okay then, this was my first gp, so thanks for the reply!
@bossgamerproductions You’re welcome! c:
I didn't... But I filled the bar with wumpa coins. I'm safe now 😎
@henriquebinotto Good UvU
I completed the gold tier pretty early on. ;) Got everything I wanted. I’m content as far as Spyro content from it. I’m always ready for new GP stuff!
Hope to hear about the next one tomorrow. It’ll be very shortly now! I for one can’t wait to see what’s next.
I managed to get everything I needed including the new decal
For being a Spyro GP it was definitely lacking in Spyro content. I also got pretty burned out after weeks of nonstop grinding and stopped playing after I secured my spot in the 5%. I probably won't do that again for this next one lol, but I'll still try and finish the Nitro Bar again. Overrall a fairly decent Grand Prix in the end.
I wish school wasn't a thing, that way I could've completed it
@avengers_assembleif Personally I didn’t mind it so much because I thought the track was fun in my opinion and the visuals are amazing.
@avengers_assembleif But I understand why people didn’t like the trach. C:
@thiccgurllover Yea I got everything from the tiers. Got a couple of stuff from the pitstop such as the characters and a few wheels and paint jobs..just I could’ve got Viking Polar..he was so cute but oh well he’ll come back eventually. ;v;
@mao_komori Agreed
@3van_hattington Yea
@demarrioj Sameeee
@cocobandicootuwu *just wish I mean
@cocobandicootuwu Oh well!  I wasn't able to get the Evil Crunch skin but I tried my best.
@cocobandicootuwu *track
I thought the GP was really fun! The challenges were a bit of a grind to get through, but I’m glad I got all the characters, Viking Polar and Evil Coco as well. All in all, it was a fantastic GP! Can’t wait for Nina’s Night Ride!
@jamesbevin That’s good you tried your best. C:
@tru3_ch4mp10n Same! I’m so excited for Nina! ;v;
The new Spyro stage I’ll admit, could’ve been longer, more fluid and more interesting. And it’s a tad bit strange that Ripto isn’t here. But it’s still cool to see Spyro again
@masonearwood Yea :>
@masonearwood the portals are good i think
The nitro bar still goes down everyday and idk why
@kenneth_aka_joemoma Yea it’s so weird lol
I had a lot of fun with the Grand Prix & the Spyro stage but I feel like the stage could’ve benefited from sections giving you Ultimate Sacred Fire.
Aww god bless
shut up i love you dummy

We collect a few controllers oursleves😀 and a couple of them thanks to you wonderful people👍
No worries at all friend 💚 yes we def need to play some more retro on my next trip up
Oh never seen these before 👏
I have a bunch of Wii controllers but that’s really it
@thegamer.adam neither had I
@tufsig_collects awesome mate thank you so much again🙌
@real_dave_brown I know your collection is goals
@alexyoungmedia a collection of any controller is great 👌
Niceeeeee!
So you have the super famicom
Yes I seem to be collecting fight sticks and Xbox controllers. Ahhh no more! 😝
Love this 😍😍
Actually saw a Panasonic Gamecube controller, on a MJR video. Never seen one before, you still on the lookout for some? Maybe your next Japan trip will unearth some.
@therushden I bloody hope so!
Looks Great 😃
They look great.👌🙂 I have found myself buying more controllers over the last couple of years, that and boxed DS consoles.
I do love collecting controllers, now thanks to you, I have the map to my next treasure!

It's your fault
Are you retarded
2018?
@gage6106 lol do ever try playing pubg mobile ?
2018** oh yeah 11 years later.. I wonder what the graphics would look like.. nigga put 2019:... Like wtf that's a year not 11 tf
Cómo cuando no tenes SSD xd
@kadersman14 🤣🤣
2018-->8 years later----->2019?
@justin_raven826 could you shut up
Playing pubg in potato pc🙄🙄 with high Ping😂😂
Yeah that's 11 years
2018 + 11 = 2029
U can't expect to run 2019 games using the same pc of 2008 played Minecraft 😂😂😂😂.
2018...2019...11 years
*2008*
For real though. Enough of these incomplete unpolished Betas.
@asap_willlie Mobile is a real platform 🤦‍♂️educate yourself please. I play pubg on my computer as well and it runs beautifully, I don’t know what kind of half assed shitty computer you got that can’t run pubg, that’s pretty sad tbh.
Have u seen free fire?
But that’s how I see guns I want to get first 😂😂😂 when I drop
More like 2017 but ok
Still a fun game
Yeah 2018
so people still playing PUBG???🤡🤡🤡
wait a minute 2018!!!
i know pubg is bad
@trippie.jayson No real gamer tries to defend his point by backing it up with mobile gameplay when they have apperently a PC that "runs beautifully". I think your the one that needs the education buddy.👍
Wtf
@heftyjedi_17 hush
@garo_jandro poop
@heftyjedi_17 this is about having an ssd and a good overall system lol
@heftyjedi_17 this is about having an ssd and a good overall system lol
@asap_willlie any “real gamer” shouldn’t have to back up their point with a PC or the best console they have. If you’re a “real gamer” you’ll use any device/platform you have to back up your points and or use it as a reference. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Please like I said educate yourself.
@trippie.jayson You're the one that uses the worst platform to defend your point when you claim to have one of the best platforms but forgot to mention it till you got shit for playing mobile and I'm the one that needs to educate? Get a real phone and play on a real platform.
@buryakov_bogdan22 they both have nothing on world of Warcraft
Your pc is the problem dude 😂😂
And u have the lowest settings on pubg lol
😂
Even the thought of pubg makes me want to punch something. That game aesthetically all around is awful.
Do u mean 2008 instead of 2018
😂
2018?😂
This guy is on weed
@kingdevo.vr yes
@skoo_no_ver Incorrect. The post is flashing forward 11 years from top to bottom because the top is clearly a 2008 game.
@cafuller8 @gamology I’ve offered to proofread your shit before you post a couple of times. You make an error, especially grammar and spelling, in at least 80% of your posts.
Agreed. Still dont mean that the graphics were that bad
Breakpoint textures look this bad even on the one x
Well you messed it up it's supposed to say 2008
Isn’t supposed to be 2008 not 2018
2018 + 11 = 2019 surrrreeeeeeeeeee
Have you heard of rdr2
@sethro943
2018?
criss😥
@cafuller8 it’s 2019 and the game still looks like that so technically this post is correct
2018??
2018........2018?
2018?
I gotta be honest, pubg is shit
2029 is 11 years from 2018
That's mainly happening for moblie because of server and game lag cuz the game is FUCKING 2 GBS!!! But I dont think that's the problem
@heftyjedi_17 Boi pub g hasn't had improvements cince it was released
I think you should go back to school
@buryakov_bogdan22 "fortnite on top" okay buddy
@gage6106 that's how much graphics his pc can support.
@buryakov_bogdan22 fortnite looks like kids jumping around and things that are way too imaginary. You can't say the same thing to fortnite
Oh yeah cause pubg was released in 2029
Uncultured child, that is not the game, that is your computer and internet, the long distance models are still loaded.
@buryakov_bogdan22 they're both pretty terrible
Yea a man 2018 was really 11 years ago
however this happens if you play with a pentium 4
Seems like there level of detail system is broken/buggy or they have it somehow set up on the server.. which would not make any sense
You had several long hours to delete and fix the 2018😭😭😭😭
@danrundle_
@heftyjedi_17 its pubg's end idk
@buryakov_bogdan22 tf?
Bruh check your typo's there is always so many.💀
Just look on Battlefield instead. 😅
battlefield 5 and pubg pc/ps allow us to introduce ourselves
They weren’t trying to put 100 players in one map back in the day either lol
True they needa fix pubg so many things they can do to make it better 🔥
only 1 year apart? aight
@cafuller8 @wooosh_police
Cant even meme
Its called rendering
*2008
@buryakov_bogdan22 lol fortnite is gargabe too 🗑️
Yes 2018 plus 11 is 2019
2018-2019=11 WTF MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE
I like retro gaming but that's too much i think
@heftyjedi_17 stick to fishing my guy
Lmao stick to putting your peter in your own hands my guy
@tuckerairsoft because the cpu is older
@heftyjedi_17 i can run every game without washed out graphics, but pubg always has washed out graphics for about 5 secs when i land
Tilt the game's graphic setting to HD then its a bit better
Pubg when you have bad gpu
@buryakov_bogdan22 lmao both pubg and fortnite are dead minecraft has completely risen
2008*
@memesnanime exactly
@im_ben_shapiro true
I still can't believe that crysis will be released too early for its time
@kingdevo.vr 2008
Haha!
Pubg is shit and the graphics the gameplay all bad peak peak peak peak 😂😂😂
@trippie.jayson Maybe if you played on a real platform you'd know
@fabiohsa 😂😂
@kingdevo.vr in the first pic they're saying "how graphic will look like in 11 years"
2008 + 11 = 2019
Crysis 1 is a 2008's game
2008**
2018+11=2019 ?????
come on pubg 😭😂
@asap_willlie now that's the stuff I wanna hear
Breakpoint is fucking gorgeous maxed out
Glitch😂😂😂😂😂
Abe chutiyo pubg ke alawa bhi duniya hai kabhi forza horizon ka Naam Suna hai
Anyone else play conquers bad fur day?
Good maths
Pubg sucks
This is what happens when you try to play pubg on an 11year old machine...😂😂😂 And you blame the game.😐
Get a ssd
@_hxmie_  no the picture of 2018 had good graphics in 2019 way worst so people wonder what it would look like in 2029 or what ever you think that’s just what I think
@lance.prows yeah
Crysis still has the best graphics no matter in which year the game is released..
😂
Wdym 2019
This is a console problem in heavy games. I had this all the time on games like gta, fortnite, h1z1 while on playstation. Haven't had this once on PC.
*2008
@heftyjedi_17 has nothing to do with internet
Yes. 18 plus 11 is 19.
Wrong. If you have good internet this doesn't happen
@heftyjedi_17 wrong, if you you have a trash graphics card this will happen
@heftyjedi_17 I have good internet and this still happens it’s involved with the cpu and gpu still rendering all the little fine details and pixels and since the original Xbox one is older it will almost always look like this since the cpu and gpu (integrated into the cpu ) has a harder time rendering those details this ending up with a filler for those details aka roblox graphics
That's google maps
2017 pubg? Haha funny
What game is on top? I don't know it..
These are 2017 graphics tho
@justin_raven826 no
@eric_malbeuf14 Cool Bro👍
👉？2018
👌👉2008
@justin_raven826 no😤
@eric_malbeuf14 Nice dude. So much emotion in your words🤙
Pubg looks way better now, you just need a good device
It’s just because pub g is an “open world” game. Having to support 100 players isn’t easy to do with AMAZING graphics. All about perspective. Crysis was all about supporting just one player with a set graphics program. Not an online ever changing graphics program that has a MASSIVE area to cover that was supposed to support around 100 players.
18-19
Is this actually real? I don’t play the game so I don’t know. Still hilarious though
@neverland762 it's still shit
@mlawrence02 I wouldn’t think so. It’s still getting improved on.
@im__pickle__rick__ Crysis
@augustus_rhcp crysis 1 I presume. I've played 2 and 3.
@im__pickle__rick__  an absolutely masterpiece
@augustus_rhcp thank u😂 I legit thought that but didn't think that 😅 the arm is pretty signature
Está mal escroto
Fortnite is gay
I like turtles...
Best idea for a game with the worst execution ever. Sad.
@barak_hd hate to see it!
Fr tho pubg graphics and the way the game runs is trash😂
2018...
2018??
That is all on your internet. Not the game.
@justin_raven826 no
No Joke PUBG’s graphics out here looking like a water color painting.
@caadenallen cool bro.....
@frank.rivera247 look at any other game running realistic graphics. Lack of cartoons is no excuse for incompetence
@justin_raven826 no
4K hd quality 120 FPS
@caadenallen 🤣👍
@sufyan_kamran HAHAHA😂
Pubg fucking shit fortnite on top
@nickkr71 no not at all, you just need to have a good phone honestly. I have the Xr and PUBG runs great on it, now if you had the galaxy s10 that just came out (which I really want cause it’s the best phone out there right now) you would be perfectly fine. It honestly all depends on your phone and if it’s good enough to run high def graphics
Shot on Android
@cls_whoosh which is still a downgrade.
CRISIS juegazoo❤️😎
I have never like this shit pubg
@scroofromero no
@rija_kamran ghar load hi nai hotae 😂😂
The caption is kinda confusing but i think ik what you meant
Everyone knows that it's the rendering process, y'all stop🙄
Gamology come on ! 🙄
My pubg never look like in your post. 👎👎👎
Potato be like 🤭
2018...
2018...
2018...
It’s trying to run real graphics and not cartoon characters like fortnite tf
not pubg or any game's fault. its ur poor ass fault coz of having a potato wifi lmao
Graphics Are A Big Reason Why Fortnite Beat PUBG
You mean 2008*
@_evilbot urwell, yes it's pc game and console too
😒😪😤
2018 😂😂
@cafuller8 no their just sayin it’s gon get worse, if 2018 got good graphics why is it worse in 2019
Still more fun than fortnite
@kingdevo.vr They’re*
@cafuller8 😂
@cafuller8 💀well ok
Should’ve used crisis as the thing from 2005
What game on the top picture is?
Dudee you never known until u know free fire 🤭
Gameplay>graphics
I played this game for almost 1 year, it was really fun and I enjoyed it so much.. But then i started to see some of these bugs/glitches in the game... Like the infinite loading screen, like literally 5 minutes of loading for the map, I had to jump off the plane as last, in the ocean.. Freezes and more. That's not my PC's fault, I play a lot of games more high then pubg, and I have no problems.. They really f*****d it up
So 2018 plus 11 is 2019?
Can’t wait to see what math tricks  and proofreading we will be doing in 11 years.
Pubg new patch is dumb😩
@kingdevo.vr crysis 1 (2008)
Yes I agree. The year 2018 really did feel  it was 11 years long.
@_evilbot it's Crysis
2018+11=2019
@reinheart03 ohh thx bro, is that pc game?
Also you might want to compare similar games. 100 player MP PUBG( and before it renders even) compared to a game known to push the limits of graphics even after 10 years is a bullshit comparison.
You mean 2008*?

@sask_and_destroy528 thanks man. I think I want to start a arcade collection series.
@osakadonvittorio
Our only true arcade in Regina Wonderland had to close down when the neighbouring business caught fire. The smoke damage in the building was too expensive to repair. A true shame.
@sask_and_destroy528 That's too bad. I wonder if the machines suffered any damage?
@osakadonvittorio they sold as much as they could in an online auction.
Oh pretty sweet. I would love to have the tmnt games in a home arcade, if I ever had a house big enough to hold them. Haha. Japanese apartments are pretty damn small.

Big day for you huh?
That's awesome! Congratulations, Nick Fury is amazing !  I pulled my 3rd tech awakening gem in a row... I have no good tech champs that are worth it, so they are just sitting in my inventory collecting cyber dust. It was really a gut shot.  Would have had a use for any other class. Feels like pulling 3 Iron Patriots in a row from a 6* crystal .
I pulled a mutant and I don’t have a mutant!
I pulled a mutant aaaaaand I awakened Domino 💥🤘
pulled a mutant... don’t have one..
😮
I did the exact same thing. Nick is so good awakened
I pulled a skill gem too and awakened killmonger. Now his super lvl is on 88 👌🏽
Is nick fury worth it? I have a skill awakening gem as well, thinking between him km or winter soldier.
I get mysterious🙌
@dark_el_dragun winter soldier ? Nah lol nick fury is beast he needs the dupe and no high sig levels he is your best option
Same as me, awakened my nick fury
Absolutely love my R5 Fury. So much fun to play
@mr._.thony thanks!
@dark_el_dragun killmonger really only needs the the dupe for defense
Good move brother I'm too got a 5* skill but i got a 6star nick so who would i give blade or aegon or shall i save it for future
@whitemike40 ah ok, thanks bro!
17?😳 Wooah😅
@lammadia I have a problem😂😂

Was muss man da machen?
@_thefoxgirl_ Beat Saber ist ein Musikspiel, wo man rhythmisch mit Laser Schwertern, Blöcke zerschlagen muss. Stufe Normal ist kein Problem, Hard schaffe ich so langsam aber auf Expert bekomme ich Anfälle. Schaffe nicht mal die hälfte von einem Level
@veganado_gaming klingt lustig 😅 aber ich glaube VR wäre nichts für mich ich vertrage 3D schon nur bedingt 🙈
@_thefoxgirl_ Also bei bestimmten Spielen habe ich auch Motion Sickness. Und länger als 2-3 Stunden geht es bei mir auch nicht.
@veganado_gaming ich glaube nicht dass das gesund ist 😅
@_thefoxgirl_ Also Beat Saber kann man aber als Sport sehen😂😂
@veganado_gaming 🤣🤣 naja ich meinte eher das ich nicht weiß ob das für die Augen oder das Gehirn so gesund ist 😅
@_thefoxgirl_ Also gesundheitsfördernd ist es auf jedenfall nicht😂 aber lange und viel geht es eh nicht
Dope! What game and what controller?
Wow! How do you get the controller to connect to the phone? I've never seen this before :)
@erock510 the game is called ‘dust: an elysian tail’. about 1000 games are compatible with a game controller and you can find these games using an app called ‘controller’ so you don’t have to guess which games are compatible. gaming companies are slowly making their new and old games compatible to game controllers. i’m using a controller called ‘horipad ultimate wireless game controller’, a MFI using bluetooth connection, but you can now pair your ‘dualshock 4 wireless playstation controller’ and/or ‘xbox wireless controller’ to your ios 13 iphone.

@bhtsakhtlaunda in dragonball z he did and even some of super lool
@everythinganime95 😂
@bhtsakhtlaunda 😂😂👍
🔥🔥🔥
@bhtsakhtlaunda if you have a problem with his sexy hair go cut them💇🏼💇🏼💇🏼
Goku ofc
@ltstanjiro 🔥👍
Krillin is too OP
@nicholas.perez.52035772 yea 😎🔥
Goku
@tahakhurshid235 😂😂
Still Goku. Krillin is human. Humans are weak.
Wtf man
@zoro_luffy_sanji__ 🔥👍
@tis_me_suckers lool imagine him as a sayain 😂😅
@__m_r_n_b_d lool what’s wrong 😅😂
@anarchist_tree wrong
@noctisami dude I don't care I have shit to do and 598 more words until this essay is done and I don't have any out of 7 missing homework assignments done I'm just too tired to think and that is the first thing my brain said maybe krillin could win I don't care I just to fucking know why I will ever NEED TO KNOW THE FUCKING THE PHILOSOPHY OF ATHENS VS SPARTA BECAUSE I DON'T FUCKING CARE!!!!!
@anarchist_tree oooo, uhm... I-I should go..
Krillin
@fbs.archives which case and point, goku was always stronger. However to ho to this form, krill in would be an alien, fom planet Vegeta. This makes him an enormous amount stronger, and on an even base with goku
Krillin looks fuckin litt🔥🔥🔥🔥👌💪
@famous.stranger_ i actually havent finished the dragon ball series yet so... idk
@anarchist_tree if you had shit to do, why did you right a whole fucking paragragh?
@bot_legend_ faxxx
@issdabigmun lool 😂😂
@issdabigmun finish it lool 😅😂
@fbs.archives nah not at all super blue is about the same level give or take a little plus Krillin smart and could come up with a plan to win 😅🔥
@big_tate777 🔥🔥👍
@off.oscar loool Krillin had hair in dragonball z 😂😂
@anarchist_tree 👍🔥
Idk😂
@animediscover lool 😂😂😂
Goku is dumbass. So killin might win
@everythinganime95 yea, i know
@everythinganime95 Im always late to everything
krillin
Damn 😅🔥
Krillin 🔥
Krillin
@abdulhadi1789 yea 😎🔥
@maskanime1 😂🔥
@factz4animes nice 👍😎
@the_chief_experience 😎👍
Imagine if krillin had a nose
This is funny cuz it's just a power amplifier, so it's essentially base goku's vs base krillin
@issdabigmun how did krillin got hair?
Why this foo krillin all of a sudden grow hair lol
Goku still

(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ OMG both are awesome
He does get a shiny but it's going to be a promo
@jake316hart So it's going to be shit, great
@pokemonguydanny along with sogaleo, and lunala in the same box...2 golds and shiny ray
Expensive box tho
@jake316hart Still it will be a 50$ card at first, In a year it will be 10$.. Ugh
@pokemonguydanny Yeah, that's why I'm just getting the box outright. Can't go wrong with that statue, playmat, and 15 pack combo alongside the godly promos
@jacky.ha.313 👌😋
@zmatt_tcg Promos are not going too be worth much.. I would have rather a pulled Ray Ray 😬
@pokemonguydanny I feel like you're too focused on the price of the cards rather than the beauty of it. Remember, there was a time when skyridge booster boxes were $500 a piece, and that time was less than 7 years ago! The price jump didn't change the way the box looks, and even though it's worth a new sports car, it's still just as beautiful as it was. That's why I'm hyped for these promos, they look beautiful no matter what the cost people will set on them
@zmatt_tcg That's apples and oranges, 2 different things.. Not even in the same ballgame 😊
@pokemonguydanny Perhaps not, but I guess I see it a little differently with my favorite card being a common and all. I don't like the idea of money being the center of the collection.
@zmatt_tcg Do you remember the Mew/Mewtwo box a few years ago?? The box was like 150$ and the cards were expensive.. Now the cards are like 10/15$ each.. An expensive box does not translate to future value even though the cards are nice.. I'll post cards I'm talking about tomoro 👍
@pokemonguydanny I don't think you get my point. I just think that value doesn't equate to beauty. You shouldn't be mad that the beautiful promos are only a certain price. They're still beautiful.
He is getting a shiny box here in November "Hidden Fates Premium box" starring shiny Rayquaza
He is lol hidden fates ultra premium box coming out mid november already got mine on pre order.
@zmatt_tcg I agree with you! I saw people getting annoyed because the stain glass bird trio was a promo! Didn't matter to me, I got the Hidden Fates ETB just for that amazing card!!! I never sell any of my cards though, I just collect to look at them so value means nothing to me 🥰

OHMY GOD on saturday everyone was trying to finish the train daily challenge and it was a bloodbath so i just went on defensive but then they tried to kill my horse and long story short i ended up crying
So true
Honestly every player I've met so far are friendly, gta on the other hand..
trust isuues🤣
especially after micah happened to them🤣🤣🤣
Every time I get out of defensive mode I get attack with someone with a shotgun
Fr thoooo 😂
So fucking true
Exactly right
Is that blazing saddles?

@chefsquib
(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ OMG what kind of chicken Pokémon is it 😂
I have not tried this one 🤔🤔 def. Let me know how it is!!
How'd it go?
Yeah it’s pretty much the same 😂
@casualcollector12345 I have a theory, this one the spice is added last and the X2 it's added before the stir fry portion.. I think the stir fry activates the spice packet more in 2X.. This I had no issue eating this.. Thoughts??
@pokemonguydanny makes sense to me! You’re the chef here but makes sense!
@casualcollector12345 Right?? I think so..I'm going to eat this one again but stir fry it, see what happens 🌶️🔥

Love this and Cuphead no matter how frustrated I get at it haha
👌❤️
@ashlynjoy.11 same!
🤣🤣🤣 That's brilliant 👏😊💖
Very cool!! (This game looks very intriguing to say the least! And if it evokes rage quits, then it sure is worth my time 😂)
Happy birthday Cuphead! The music alone makes me very very happy. I feel your pain though, Brian.
@jtobias02
Awww @briankesinger !!! Love this!!!!
Cuphead reminded me of the old school Strider arcade game. Super difficult, but so addictive. I’ve actually seen a custom Cuphead Arcade game recently.
It’s been a couple weeks since I haven’t beaten the dragon... taking a break lol
This is so awesome!!
😂😂😂👍
A moment of silence for all the controllers lost playing this game. 😂
Game looks so great. There is a download for the switch. Probably will get it after finishing Links aweakening. Do you play it on a console?
Haha true!!!
Hi😘
cup head is finger suicide
Truer words were never spoken.
Omg- I could never get past the third world.  So.  Brutal.

@gambit268 exfuckingcuse me?
@gambit268 oh wait no the mana series is a spin off of that... Right?
This game omg the memories of me being a little kid trying to beat this omg lol the torture my little 6 year old brain lol now a days kids just play fortnite with no end game in sight !
@bodhihammer another series that was renamed for the west. It’s the first game in the Mana series
@gambit268 well. My whole life is a lie.

I would 1000% buy that Starman and just checked Etsy for it. Will it be available?
@phineashamak if you’re interested then I’ll definitely get it up.  Check back later this evening.  It’ll be with the other lil earthbound buttons listing. 😊
@superstitchsis Just ordered it! :)
@beardedgeek72 Providence Equity Partners invested over 300million to help expand ZeniMax, which is a reason of mobile games, creation club, and 76 because they're trying to appeal to the investor. If the investor ends up buying them were stuck with EA-2.0 Todd probably doesn't want this, it's all ZeniMax and Providence
@the_laughing_pumpkins preach man, this is the true information that we wanted to hear about for the past 5 or 6 years
@anakin_gg
@synth3tic5 you forgot I’m not the *fucking* messiah is tho or smth soooo
@the_laughing_pumpkins well they picked the partner. Also no matter I am done with Bethesda at least until I have proof that their  next game will be single player only and no micro transactions.
@beardedgeek72 we all know it will have microtransactions and it will most likely be single player, I don't entirely know what you mean by they picked the partner. If you mean Bethesda they don't really control that, it's all ZeniMax and Providence until Providence most likely buys them out, then it'll all be Providence. But maybe if the next few ID, Bethesda, and whatever other devs ZeniMax owns don't sell very well then Providence might not buy out
If I remember correctly (I probably don't) if Providence buys out ZeniMax then it'll be a publicly shared company, meaning you can buy stock in them. Which I guess is cool...
🎵Always look on the bright side of life🎶
If the Messiah never followed through on his promises
Ohhh yup this is the life of Brian
fallout nv fans: hes satan!
Bethesda is equally bad as EA
@james_mitchell1533 godd
The Bethesda community increasingly does not love Todd Howard
@bob__the_anime_tiddy_dealer Publishers are bad in general
Tom Holland is slowly losing faith among the community
Life of bwian
@nasianv what
@indisplutably Life of Brian is criminally underrated for meme potential
@kalameetos 😂
God Howard
It’s great to see Monty python memes again
Tawd the Gawd Howard.
God coward
Haven't really ever seen any Life of Brian memes, I'm impressed
Why would anyone think he's the messiah after they turned into an incompetent version of EA?

@pretty_vibez20 yaaaaasssssss and I'm loving the remastered version they released.
Crash and Tomb Raider
Crash, tekken 3, and cool boarders were my go tos
@retro.gamer.dad @thenintendoworld @unsealedgames @rad_dad_gaming
@theycallmesolo cool boarders was my shit!
@hardeeharhar86 are you referring to the demo disc?
Shoot..I played so many. Spent a lot of time playing Tomb Raider, gran Turismo, but the reason I got a PlayStation was Tekken.
@rad_dad_gaming yes bro Tekken 3 blew my young mind when it came out
@hardeeharhar86  man it takes me back. Gaming back then was epic
@hardeeharhar86 BRO I SWEAR!  I wish someone remastered Soul Reaver though cause that would be sweet. Are you going to get that medievil when it comes out?
I still remember the first games that came out with the PlayStation like battle arena toshinden, tekken, wipEout and twisted metal
@edmonem  twisted metal that game would be insane in this day and age
Crash, Tomb Raider, and Tony Hawk 💕

I don’t really enjoy battle royale games very much, personally. Apex is a little bit better than most, but still not my cup of tea.

I hope you have a wonderful night, though! :)
@embracing.julianna I agree totally they aren’t really my cup of tea. 😊 Thank you! Hope you have a wonderful night as well. 🤗🌸
If apex had single servers I would be all over it I hate playing with randos
@alexander_thomas_92 I feel that lol 👌🏼
Hey! If you like rainbow six siege you should check out my profile too! My account really needs some growth! Thank you💛 have fun in siege
Hate em
I like turtles...
In my opinion.. and this is just my opinion. They are the worst, I absolutely cannot play these types of games.
But like R6 thoooo ❤️❤️ been obsessed with R6 since it dropped. Even though my KD hasn’t changed since I’ve had it not sure why cause I’m a million times better than I was when I started. 😅
😍😍😍😍
APE
I think battle royals have grown so much to the point where it’s the future of gaming, all the updates is just gonna make battle royals change the way of gaming to another level
@alexander_thomas_92 did you catch the limited time solo mode recently?
I think in some ways battle royales can help a gamer refine their FPS skills. Having 1 shot, 1 life (most of the time) in a game can make a person really think about their actions and work on aim and such.
Bullshit but I must say that apex is a good game
I hate Apex. It's fornite on roids
@amin.lamrabtine yeah can’t wait to give the new map a go
I love apex. That game is a masterpiece to me.
The only BR game I'll play is Apec lol one of the best BR games in my personal opinion
Nice ❤️❤️
This game is legendary
I have 3k kills and 230 seasons 2 wins haha

What would happen if someone reposted this?
@red.dead.evan Honestly,there isn’t much I would be able to do except ask them to delete it. If they refused to delete it,I would ask them to give me credit for the screenshot,meaning: tell everyone where they got the picture by tagging me in the caption and in the photo itself ❤️❤️ but I would really prefer that my screenshots aren’t reposted. I’m just funny about it haha
@arthrmorgan Yeah I understand. I'm kinda new to this whole "do not repost thing" so I just wanted to get some advice about it. Have a good one m8
@red.dead.evan Makes sense! It’s all good :) I know it can be confusing
So cool to see that this game is still amazing people after all these years. You still have enough time to finish it until part two comes out in February 2020 😂
@arthrmorgan it can be😁
@_._yin_._ yessss. I found out about it back in 2015 and I loved it instantly. I’m so excited for part two!!
@arthrmorgan Me too! It looks even better than the first game
@_._yin_._ It’ll be interesting to see what they do with Ellie’s character. I can’t wait
Keep grinding 🔥 I can provide you an awesome intro just dm me

Nice looking shelf! Pretty cool games in this collection, how long have you been collecting?
@pabgames thanks! I would say about a year collecting. Although about 1/3 of them date back to my childhood when I was collecting without realizing it
@retroplaytendo awesome! That’s pretty good for a year and yeah I hear ya. My collection has a lot of stuff from childhood but also a lot has been lost in moving and stuff through the years. Keep up the good work! Physical > digital in my opinion lol

Hype needs it the most 😉
Hype and champion for boss aw
Vtd
Hype doesn’t need awakened. Annihilus awakened for defense will be good. Same with the champion. VTD for questing.
Hyperion, no doubt about it. Everybody else may have a nice quirk but none of them will benefit you like Hyperion.

@connor_larcombe_
Captain Marvel in the center 🤮. Should be the Black Panther
@mcd.arts Should be either Black Panther or Scarlett Witch. Black Panther due to his sheer badassness and popularity, Scarlett Witch because she’s truly earned it as one of the surviving Avengers.
@okkiashauki HaWkEyE sHoOt BoW
Booo! Captain marvel. Boo!!!
Bru how many times they gon do this typa theme
@yaqdiesel exactly
Please do not tease me like that!!!! Really cool! But I so wish this was real!
Quién te conoce Shang Chi
@dproblemfitness  @thetrillcity
@troymaine510 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
@troymaine510 honestly if they don’t bring the original cast back Robert as Tony, Evans as Cap, Hugh as Logan  it ain’t gonna have the same IMPACT for me...... hopefully Spiderman makes it in cause those rights are going back........ fuck Fox and Disney for not striking a deal years before ...... I’m so sad seeing this picture
Cut out all the black people??
Is it just me or is Thor now one of those that should be feared the most by villians? I mean he literally chopped off the head of the one who killed half of the universe
@kalexander3005 war machines there, but should replaced captain marvel with black panther tho 🤷🏼‍♂️
Where is Sam Wilson?
Shang Chi looks so out of place with his overpowered coworkers😂
I need new mutants and dark phoenix cyclops against the avengers
Please get captain sjw outa there
@thalastmeheecan nope.
@yikmunphotography hahaha you right
@thalastmeheecan 😂😂😂
Ok but what is hawkeye gonna do
@vancityreynolds ..hahaha
@yikmunphotography and Hawkeye / Ronin
Stop playing with my feelings. 😥
@a_ortizzz
@yikmunphotography he honestly  shouldn’t be there . There’s not much point in having him there when facing someone like galactus
@sbentzz
Bring in moon Knight

I was 14 years old and had just won 10th in a national fishing contest, I got 800 dollars in the end of August 1996 and had reserved my machine early with electronics boutique at the mall who took a limited number of orders, was very proud to walk in there and pay cash for my n64 with pilotwings and MARIO 64.  I started grade 9 that fall and had a  very competitive race with a friend to see who could get all 120 stars first.  Love that gaming console. Great picture!👍🏻
What a cool TV

why whenever they say i look tired in game i suddenly feel tired irl???
@fuze54
@teamsporks i dont have a problem just cuz im playing at 2am 😂
@s.remily TRUE
Dotty is literally my favorite ac character and she’s so sweet and if I ever play my ac again and I see that she left my town, imma start crying
You didn't want to try Josephine?
@the_trevelyans hey, it's a good idea for sure but she's just a bit too sweet for this Inquisitor. Also, I was thinking about how she and Leliana were like best friends, so it felt kinda wrong... These are the weird thoughts I have playing dragon age lol
@screencaptive Josephine seems sweet and proper but she was once a bard and she has quite a cunning mind. She might not weld a dagger but her quill can kill 🤣🤣
Yooo u joined pc gang

Farcry
Definitely all the Assassin's Creed games 😍 and I'm really looking forward to God's and Monsters!
Black Flag & Far Cry 3 👌
Odyssey and Origins. Both stellar games with my favorite assassins. Ubisoft has done really well this gen. All of these games are well done. 🙌🏾 🔥
The Far Cry Series is a complete stand out for me and I have really enjoyed the last two releases. Assassin's Creed has also stepped its game up and I like that they keep taking it in different historical directions.
Such an awesome store. 🖤🖤🖤

@mcufanwithaplan same bro
If you have a 3DS or a PSVita you can easily find it on amazon. Other than that, you can only buy it digitally :/
@the.origins.batman_tv imma jump off a bridge
@thatnerdycritic its best on a PSvita or bought digitally so you can get the deluxe edition on consoles
Don’t forget Arkham VR
@silaslogic301 don’t make me remember
I found my old copy of blackgate a few days ago buried in a box of legos 😎
@comrade_gingurspicelatte evil
@silaslogic301 Non Canon
@the.origins.batman_tv the ps vita had a "play on PS4" Mode if i remember correctlt
@arkham_quinn_memes did it? I dunno I don't own one lol. I played it on 3DS
@the.origins.batman_tv i think it did
@the.origins.batman_tv wait there’s a deluxe edition of Blackgate?
Make sure to play Arkham City Lockdown too 🗿🗿🗿
@geek_access frick
I have never even thought of playing blackgate
@thatnerdycritic yeah i didnt know
@thatnerdycritic yep. its on Xbox 360, PS3, and im pretty sure PC but im not certain
The idea of bringing back a classic and improving it in many ways is something I love overall. Also it’s a good way to make new people try out something from the past.
@coolfirefox_2.0 Yep. That's 180% true bro :D
I am fucking hyped 4 the full game m8

No es por exagerar, pero no pase ningun juego de mi infancia (sacando el mario bros) tuve que  esperar a poder emularlos con una pc, para poder terminar juegos imposibles!!! Sin importar la consola o si eran arcade, los video juegos de antes eran imposibles!!! Y el que piense lo contrario que pase al Ghost n goblins 🤣
Es esta otra bendita referencia a JOJO'S?????
Estoy de acuerdo con la última, es innecesario tener que pagar para poder tener una parte del juego :v
El abuelo sabe!!! 🤣😅😂
Si los juegos de hoy en día no tuvieran DLCs, saldrían el doble por todo el laburo que demanda hacerlos. Gente con algo de vagina en su arena comentando en 3, 2...
@franciscoberguecio
Aprende @ramigomez0107 y  gamer eran los de antes, como tu papa💪💪💪
Aprende @juancruz93 gamer eran los de antes, como tu tio
Jajaja muchos nostálgicos diciendo que gamer era el de antes... de seguro hoy intentan jugar a los últimos lanzamientos y se pierden como los mejores. Indudablemente la industria nos trajo muchísimas cosas negativas en las últimas dos décadas, pero no por eso todo es malo. Las cosas cambian si o si, quieran o no. Pero bueno, la nostalgia hace su laburo también.

@inzillovalentino así estaremos en 30 o 40 años
@zeequiiel en mis épocas se soplaba los cartuchos cuando no funcionaba el juego o le daba patadas a la maquina si se trababa la ficha je je je je je je

@malditosnerds mi viejo tiene 46 años y siempre jugo a los videojuegos!! Hasta me gana en fortnite >:v lpm
La verdad es q los juegos de ahora son fáciles mas para casuales .pero no todo es malo gracias a que fueron evolucionando en tema de gráficos se pueden ver maravillas como sekiro, dark souls o metro exodus entre otros .sin contar los remakes de juegos antiguos .en fin la industria avanzó y retrocedió es segun de donde lo ves
Apoyo el último jajaja, los DLC no deberían existir
Lo banco fuerte en lo ultimo
por culpa de esa jojoreferencia los voy a dejar de seguir

@malditosnerds Si claro, van a salir uno o 2 cada años, de hecho salen juegos digamos algo difíciles pero son hecho por fans o empresas pequeñas que aman ese estilo de juego. A gran escala con presupuesto casi no salen, no es rentable para ellos.
uno tenía que soplar para jugar un juego que en la tapa era una película de spielgberg y adentro el PONG
Like si lo leíste como abuelo gritandote 😂🤣
cuando se te laguee sopla la ficha.. eso hacíamos nosotros con los cartuchos cuando no andaban

Che se olvidó el remate
@valeryperezt @rudolfstayner
Los abuelos de 20 años 😂😂
Mas allá de que tenga o no razón (que la tiene), creo que es más importante discutir por qué el artista puso a Mista en el *CUATRO*
Que viejo más pesao
@emanuelshu_ 😂
@mo_bust1
Clave el póster de mista
Is this another jojo reference?
Cuanta razón tiene Beto. La industria ha venido a menos pero bueh. Le faltó decir que cuando el epicentro de los juegos era Japón, los juegos eran mejores.
Jugando neneeee!! Jugandoooo!!!
En mi epoca, comprabas los juegos en la Shell
Bueno claramente los juegos de hoy en día son cada vez más fáciles, porque la idea es vender más que otra cosa.
En lo ultimo tiene razón, antes los juegos venian completos. Ahora nosotros somos los testers y hay que pagar mas del 3/4 del "juego final"
Yo ya me siento asi y tengo 22😂😂😂
El 5 es posta ah
JAJAJAJAJJA me siento un poco así pero a la vez agradecido de poder continuar sin empezar de cero en esta época. 😂
Cuánto nietos tiene? 😂
@juan_agustin1
Aguante los juegos fisicos papa
@benja_santillan24
Jajaj muy bueno,me siento uno de esos señores
Intenso pero lo banco, por qué es la verdad 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Mista en la imagen 4 lo ame
Eu, ese último tiene razón.
En la 4 tienen razón
@juanppaoli
Ojo a lo que digo para algunos expansiones no son lo mismo que DLC, un DLC se toma como una actualización y expansión de se compra como hace EA que literal te deja sin un peso
@yoshi.kagge pero es mista y esta en el numero 4 :(((
Lo banco no bancando los DLC.
We el abuelo cómo respira ? F
La verdad que los DLC si son cosa del diablo 👻
@santiagocourel ya eres ese abuelo??
Me acuerdo de mi infancia en la que los desafíos podían desbloquear contenido nuevo, mejor que el que los DLCs dan hoy en día
Mista en el panel número.... CUATRO?!
@damantigua jajajjaa tal cual
@damantigua sobre todo el primero
@santiagocourel jajajajaja tan de viejito q duele ❤️
@giulianoimanol decime sino es rodri jajajaja😂😂😂

@leo.crescent
Me gusta tener los juegos en formato físico 👴🏼
@julianfacchiano los abuelos somos nosotros
@leo.crescent olvídate!!!!
@vialactea2 jajaja es la pura verdad
Estoy de viejo jajajaja
En la última viñeta tiene toda la "maldita" razon 😎
Que cosa que me encantan estas mini historietas jajajaja son geniales .. Sobre todo la de este viejito
Soy yo!
La última es para EA.
@pablovazquez.art
Todos somos BETO
Loco, con lo de los DLC le doy la derecha. Cualquiera. Nosotros en Tekken para poder jugar con Heihachi Mishima teníamos que pasar la final con Jin Kazama.
Prince of Pericia, perdidas y todo desde el principio ootra vez ,🤣
@icebladeari @msgabs28
Y tiene toda la razón! Son una verga ahora😒 Por eso sigo jugando al Doom @jeremiasojeda7
Mierda, soy el viejo
😂
😜
¿@jere.carranza te pasa la del viejito amigo? 😂
Lindo poster en la 4 jabdjad
👏👏👏
Me siento re identificado con el abuelo jajaja
Que es eso de "walkthrough"? En mis epocas dabamos 999999999 vueltas en circulos sin saber como seguir, hasta que llegaba un hermano/amigo y te decia "probá haciendo esto" y pasabas (?)
JOOOOOOOJOS!!!
Ese Mista si se puede ver
Estoy de acuerdo con el DLC
Y tiene razón jajaja
ABL JAJAJAJA
Clave el cuadrito de Mista
A mis 49 años...me siento muy identificado con Don Beto!! Igual sigo jugando a full!!
EL MISTA!
Don Beto me representa en todo! A , C , arriba ,B , arriba, B,A, abajo! Excelent!
De acuerdo completamente y  agregó : en mi época teníamos que empezar las misiones desde 0 no desde últimos puntos de control
El último va con dedicación a @ea
Jaja don viejardo
Tengo 27 y me siento don Beto muchas veces, la diferencia que antes el dlc era el mismo juego con otro nombre y 3 personajes nuevos
@rafaelperino vas de nuevo jaja
@matiasrayep
Tremendo el mista de fondo
Lpm soy el abueloooooo
En mis tiempos para jugar de a dos tenias que pararte y conectar otro joystick que es eso del online (?
👏😄
Estoy de acuerdo en especial la última parte

Mine is definitely the first game. It was one of the first games I have ever played, and I enjoy fighting the Portrait Ghosts.
@hero_in_blue_ EXACTLY! Awesome family of ghosts with unique interesting backstories you can tell that there WAS a past story in that mansion not some generic comical non-unique enemy ghosts with no story or exploration and annoying repetitive missions! Yuck

Que edición tan curiosa, parece que el mando esta desparejo, no me pega con la consola
@pollitogames es simulando al baby del juego, la verdad que me gusta más la edición que el juego en el que se basa jaja

❤️"Fight!"
Mortal kombat vs berserk would sell out so crazy if the ever did make it
Guts vs scorpion 
Zodd vs Onaga 
Griffth vs Shao Kahn
Wyald vs Johnny Cage 
Skull knight vs radien 
Scorpio vs Kenshi 
That game would be so much better than mortal kombat vs dc universe
@carlos.pesina thanks for all the great memories. Raiden and Blanka were my two favorite characters growing up. ❤️ the⚡️!

@obi_wan_shinobi_14 im sure your not bad being a rep 70 shin boi. Im only rep 10 with him, he was going to be my main but I fell in love with musha
@yuh_huck 5 heavies 10 lights, i dont see a problem
@yuh_huck lol I’ve never been complimented for being a rep 70 Shinobi, thanks
@xkingmurci bud feinting heavy directly into a light doesnt count
@obi_wan_shinobi_14 yeah everyone thinks hes annoying but I disagree ;)
@yuh_huck idk why youre so passionate about this its not hard to counter
@yuh_huck I even think he’s annoying as shit now. But how they dropped him on his neck after his nerf, I guess I can’t blame him
@xkingmurci it isnt but that guy was having troubles. I wouldve just flipped you
@yuh_huck yeah, he was the type of guy who only does light bash light
@xkingmurci ah thats makes more sense now sorry for that callout didnt know
@yuh_huck thats why i said uh uh uh after he tried to bash
@xkingmurci lol yeah sorry again if I would've known I wouldnt have said anything
Lol that was epic 😂
Shaolin and shinobi are the two most fun characters to play in my opinion
didn't through a single heavy till the end fucking shit
@kman_white 🤦
@kman_white mixups*
That emot fuckin ay good shit
@kman_white throw*
@obi_wan_shinobi_14 uh uh uh
@kinghitokiri 👏
Lmao 90%of ur hits were lights
@yuh_huck lol welcome to Season 11
@yuh_huck its shaolin we're talking ab
@xkingmurci yeak ik it doesn't matter i dont light spam with him
@obi_wan_shinobi_14 yeah it sucks I miss season 1 :(
Shaolin is a meanie
Lol *points finger* BP *tries to do something* Shao*DENIED*
@yuh_huck can’t relate, joined in season 5
@obi_wan_shinobi_14 im beta but I dont talk about it because I hate the people who think theyre better because they played then. But season 1 was even more unbalanced then now but it was still way more fun
@yuh_huck that wasnt lightspam i was going into qi stance
@the_grim_prior indeed he is
@ms.execution lol
@xkingmurci you still a bitch tho lol
@yuh_huck I joined like, late season 5. I’m not good so I can’t really say I’m better than other people lol
@xkingmurci doesnt matter rewatch the video and actually tell me you werent pressing lights 5x more than any sort of heavy

@cesar_anthem you didn’t even read. I said budokai 1, not Budokai Tenkaichi 3. and i still play that game, so what do you mean? and now you over here callin me retarded? “mindless game” okay lol you’re mad bro go take a nap
@sobavsworld you talk about specs but probably say a ps4 is better than pc 🤡
@cesar_anthem i don’t but keep venting bro, i know your anger comes from a deeper place so just let it out
@cesar_anthem “real gamers” lol i literally participate in fighting game tourneys but ok
@sobavsworld ok so do I ive been playing games my whole life, ive been to local tournaments ect
@cesar_anthem dude can u stop... you’re totally off topic now go do somethin
@sobavsworld I have played both games for a year. And after that year I can say with confidence that in my opinion Dokkan is just way better. Dokkan is much more f2p friendly than legends, everything about dokkan was shit before but they have improved super attacks, nice mechanics etc. Legends however is just a cash grab imo. Legends has potential but atm it isn't better than dokkan. Give Legends time tho and it should be better than dokkan especially when characters like MUI Goku come out or ssj3 shallot. Rn its just dead...
@sobavsworld you should too youre the one who said you’re competitive
@realist_.gio Dokkan I have played since  1 year anni*
Ps youre also the only person bashing dokkan which is wayyyy more popular than legends you knew the consequences 🤡
@realist_.gio honestly i might give Dokkan another try if i see something that actually catches my eye. but when you get a phone that has an amazing display you wanna play a game that compliments that, right? it really needs a makeover imo, but as an FGC activist, i can’t really get with the standstill gameplay
@sobavsworld I have a good phone, and I am actually just waiting for legends to get better so I can take full advantage😂
i havent played since it came out its that bad of a game
Yeah I play it more than Dokkan, I can’t farm ds as of right now.
@catsaresicc well, farm then. That's why there's story, there's challenges in story, there's story events, there's a lot of events in general that gives you CC. Use those CC to get units. I will agree with you on the fact that a lot of characters are unbalanced, but they are not invincible, you just gotta learn how to play against them.
Dokkan >>>>>>>Legends
No legends is too trash rn
Not very much😂
@drippyboijojo2 ok so sounds like you had legends and either got it when it first came out before any events started, or you just sucked at it so it got boring to you 💀 gotcha
@sobavsworld no I've never had legends I've watched people play it and I've played a few times its not better than dokkan at all☠️ but it's all opinion based so theres no right answer
@robloxisrad yeah I have played ranked too but its usually the same thing for some reason. :/ plus the spam is really really bad and evasion is very very very limited
Old prone?
Why not both? 2 dragon ball games on the phone are better than 1
Nope
@terry_kornelliuzz frl they need more grindable events, I wouldn't mine more f2p characters as well
@joker_main.jpeg or there is a new banner/event
@catsaresicc Bruh, 1.2 million health is pretty normal, just soul boost your characters Lmao. Also, just dodge one and then combo your opponent, if he dodges, tap attack to stop his attack, switch immediately and either blast or dodge again.
@manolis_bro yeah but it ain't normal when you have shit units and and barely restarted the game. plus I think the characters are getting a little too unbalanced. it's ok to have a good/OP character but not to make it literally immortal and completely invincible
@danny.memes13 yeah, and certain old  units need farmable SA as well, like PHY and STR LSSJ Broly
@sobavsworld youre just tapping a screen in both games whats it matter, dokkan is a wayyyy better game btw thats why its at 300 mil downloads and hits top grossing like 2 times a month, dokkan is a better MOBILE game they should have legends be a console game instead of wasting time on mobile legends
Legends has almost always been boring
@cesar_anthem notice how every person that says dokkan is better says it without mentioning ANY specs
@sobavsworld ITS A MOBILE GAME WHO CARES ABOUT SPECS GET A PC IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SPECS BUT WERE TALKING ABOUT A MOBILE GAME... specs dont make a game and any one who isnt an idiot knows that...
@sobavsworld im not gonna argue yeah legends has better specs but dokkan is a better more entertaining popular game
@sobavsworld you need a powerful phone to play legends you dont to play dokkan so theres more variety and more players
@cesar_anthem notice how every person that says dokkan is better says it without mentioning ANY specs
@cesar_anthem it’s a mobile game with console game characteristics, so specs most definitely do matter. they don’t matter for dokkan, cuz dokkan looks like shit so y’all don’t wanna mention specs
@cesar_anthem graphics matter, no matter what you say. cuz if FighterZ came out but had the same graphics as Budokai 1, people would not play that shit at all. same with mobile games. why would i wanna play Tetris if it didn’t look any different than tetris did 10 years ago??
@sobavsworld Yes we do still play dokkan and is there a problem with that? There’s just something dokkan gives that you cant get from legends I think that’s why everyone still plays dokkan
@sobavsworld legends is boeing my guy
Of course i still do
@julian_varela952 i’m guessing y’all played NONE of the Budokai Tenkaichi series 💀 cuz Legends is the closest you gonna get to that on mobile. why would i just wanna tap colored circles? like seriously what about that screams “Dragonball”??
@sobavsworld well you don’t have to like dokkan plus I’m not talking about tenkaichi we talking about dokkan and legends
Yes
It's kinda on and off
@sobavsworld that literally has nothing to di with the fact that dokkan is better lmfaooo😂 legends will never be better than dokkan
I don't really enjoy playing legends cause it's just retards spamming the ki cards and you can't dodge all of them. and not only that, I think its just my luck but I keep getting matched with people with 1.2 mil health in just a casual match
@drippyboijojo2 but you’re not saying how tho
@julian_varela952 i was making a comparison to tenkaichi and legends because they’re close in graphics and play style so it’s part of the conversation. also why is touching circles better than an actual fighting game
@sobavsworld dokkan is better in many areas like the fact that getting a sparking in a summon is not near as closely exciting as getting a lr in a summon, and that feeling when you completed the last run to awaken the unit you've been trying to awaken and getting eager to build teams with them, dokkan isn't only a game, but a way of life
@sobavsworld I'm ugly asf for that paragraph😂
@julian_varela952 i was making a comparison to tenkaichi and legends because they’re close in graphics and play style so it’s part of the conversation. also why is touching circles better than an actual fighting game
@sobavsworld Hey I’m just saying it’s not something you have to enjoy it’s just some people like dokkan better then legends it’s just something about it I don’t what makes me wanting to come back to it I just enjoy it I play legends as well like it’s a really good game I still play it til this day I just enjoy dokkan more that’s all you catch my drift?
@drippyboijojo2 that was so baseless it was hardly an explanation. dokkan overall just feels lazy. the gameplay is the least challenging and slowest gameplay out of any dragonball game to ever come out (literally), it’s not even amusing to look at, and it doesn’t even fit a Dragon Ball aesthetic. Legends is in  full 60fps, HD renders and different abilities and animations for each character, you can make ANY character good and challenge live PVP against rare summons and still win, the grind aspect is definitely there and very rewarding, voice acting is on point, the story has gotten so good that Shallot has expensive Saiyan Blood figurines out like the other canon characters do. It takes actual skill, knowledge of the game, and reflex to win, not just touching colors dawg
@julian_varela952 the whole time i was just replying to the caption anyway tho dude
Yuh
@sobavsworld you have a lot of time on your hands☠️ but naw dokkan isn't lazy it's just animated legends looks str8 out of xenoverse . Our super attack animations are far better and the main build of the game is just shitting on legends fuck graphics and all that cuz we winning in that department its just legends gets hella boring because it's the same thing over and over again you just fight different people
@catsaresicc Casual matches don't balance between the 2 users, just play ranked.🤷‍♂️
I deleted legends for Dokkan 😂😭 not disappointed either
I play both lol. Both are kinda boring right now, waiting for the next Dokkan event.
Seeing updates for dokkan means we getting dragon stones :P
I have both
What does this mean
y’all still play dokkan?? 💀 shit ain’t even in HD
I've completed this game,epicc
OMFG I remember this game!!! It was my childhood 😭🤩

She really isn’t lol
Even .5 is greater than 0 sooooo
Nope lmao
it's like saying ariana grande is black
No she is not
Everyone who hates on Kairi just because she didn't get as much character development as everyone demanded she get: 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
This fills my heart💖
But I control Sora. How is Kairi more useful than I? =P
Kh2 kairi is the most useful kairi has ever gotten
No u
I love kairi but she really gets done dirty by the story making her a damsel in distress time and time again
Press X to doubt
@ubairhorn OH IM SORRY. MAYBE SHE WOULD’VE BEEN MORE USEFUL IS SHE HAD SOME 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
@gucci.gibbay I'm not saying she wouldn't be more useful. But people hating her solely for that reason is just stupid. She's still a great character. Plus, it's possible that in the next game, Kairi will be the one to rescue Sora for once, which would give her a vast amount of character development.
OH snap! :0
@ubairhorn she kind of already did that. Also you NEED character development so that people actually have a reason to like her
🤣
It's true 😔👌
Everyone read the sleep realm theory. I believe that their theory about why Kairi is a useless puppet is completely possible and it also valid enough to where I’m no longer pissed.
She honestly was useful. People just look at the "oh she wack and got kidnapped" side.
Thanks
Lol
Me:*sips tea* Donald:would you like me to get your keyblade sire?
Impossible
Wrong
Love this!!❤️
Wow This looks awesome! I draw too and I love this!
This is amazing
Nice
Oh gosh are we gonna see the one that hatched in Pharloom???? That was a loose end I don't feel was wrapped up in Hollow knight, so I'm hopeful :0
Hope so
ancient being 💛
It’s lame that the game claimed that the only stags living were the ones serving on the stagways. That makes zero sense.
@gulliver_milord_of_dreamwoods I mean, they Could of loved giving rides before the City took advantage and all moved to the Stagways at the opportunity, or at least as far as we've heard of
@queenlayla39 But that would mean that all corpses in the stag nest were pretty much the entire species which means that they already were on the edge of extinction when they started serving... Who were the stag racists I wonder... The ancients? Radiance? Or Pale King? Maybe it was Soul Master?
@gulliver_milord_of_dreamwoods Or maybe they live on other places if the world and that was just the Hollownest ones. Plus we don't know if there's dozens littering the Stagways since we don't technically see much of any of it in it

@reisukun get a new mic bro 😂😂
@babysharkdododododooo will do
omg i love this post 🤣🤣🤣
@hubschesmadchen.ow aw thank you that means a lot 😊
He doesn't die easily but the opposite happened with you😂😭😭
@tm.alh if you played apex you'd know he was supposed to die like 20 seconds before but there was a bug 😂
@kennimari_ idk I’m not fimeiler with the game but I noticed :)
Thank you for saving my hide! 🤣
@misanthrobotic my pleasure 😀
Yeah sorry, I don't have the money to buy it. Car maintainence and cosplay. 😭😂
In my defense, I never said I was buying it 🤟🏼😂
Telltale borderlands is the only one I've completed 😂 only partially played 1 & 2
@honour_and_steel @project_danse  It's too bad Paladin Danse or Scribe Haylen couldn't appear in the game (due to character customisation limits) would be neat for laughs to see their reactions to the ridiculousness. 😂
@ash_bow_peep something something guilt trip about how I bought PS4 to play with a new friend who may have been you. Good thing I'm not actually that dramatic 🤣. I still love you 💙💜. Looking forward to vault 94 being totally fixed 😍
@project_danse Telltale Borderlands is the only one I haven't done due to too many videos games. Not enough time.
@magic.latte I'm still running 94 because I'm a risky ass ho 😌
@magic.latte it was good I got more in to the characters that way

@cj_mahaffey
@lulupender thanks bro! Its been years in process lol. 🙏
@gl1tch_gaming thank you sensai. 🙏 One day it’ll be complete like your amazing GC collection! 🔥🎮🙌
I never played The original Lost Kingdoms but I liked Lost Kingdoms II a lot! I hope you find it one day!!
@jungeunie_ (or maybe you already have and I just don’t see it 😂)
@jungeunie_ nice! I’ve heard great things about the series. I haven’t played it myself. Haha, I do have the first one but not the second one! The second one Ive yet to see anywhere. I think its harder to find. 🙃🎮
@shadowwiidragon it’s going to be worth it!! You collect different cards as the game progresses and you use those in real-time battle kind of like summoning monsters in yugioh except there is no designated “dueling field”.
@soldmysoultosony thanks! 🙌 And thats so cool! I’ve been playing it recently and I’ve enjoyed its oddities.
@jungeunie_ oh cool!! The mechanics sound fun! I’ll have to find it soon then. 🙌🎮
Trying out this app now, always wanted something like that!
@shadowwiidragon You definitely will and if there is any titles you need help finding let me know. 👍
@gl1tch_gaming will do! Thank you so much!! 😁🙌
Holy😮
Is that Game Boy Player disc a seperate release, not seen it loose before in a case
Amazing!
Ça ressemble à ça le full set @conkerax ?
@redretr0 In the US, it was bundled in this packaging with the gameboy player itself. There was no separate release for the disc. 🎮
@ashevent thanks 😁🙌🎮
What is the name of the app?
@shadowwiidragon ah nice. Thanks for that 😁
@redretr0 no probs dude! 😊
What application is that?
😍😍😍😍😍
@vinrupo www.gameye.app  it’s out for android and ios
Wow. This is amazing 😍🔥
Amazing Wes. These stacks are prob taller than me 😂 GameCube ftw!!!
Brilliant!! 🤙🏻🔥
Verryyy nice brotha 🙌
@gymleaderveda thanks Veda! 🙌 Lolz it’s taller than both of us combined, if I did a single stack. xD I would stack all of them to the ceiling, but ya know gravity is in full effect.🙃
@nintendo.matt thanks bro! 😁🙌🎮
@0gretro thanks dude! 😊🙌🎮
@shadowwiidragon fair point 😂 the gotcha force game looks so cool!!!
@jackrabbit.gamer thanks Tara! Your posts for the tag were awesome this week! 😊🎮
@shadowwiidragon awe thanks Weston ☺️
@gymleaderveda it’s a lot of fun so far!Nothin like robots fighting each other haha. The game is sorta of like Robotech Battlecry.
Whoa 😍
that’s an amazing collection!! i remember playing cubivore when i was a kid, such an odd game but still really fun.
Good stuff bro! Do you have all the games exclusive to the system? That’s what I’m going for and there’s a few I didn’t even know existed!
Very impressive collection bro and you'll tackle that set in no time keep grinding. 👍🎮
@lulupender that’s awesome! And a great question bro. I’ll have to check the list online. From what I saw on wiki’s list, I am missing some but not many. I might have to make that my priority now for GC! 🙌🎮
Celes and Teruteru hiding in the distance
I wonder what smell the burning Celeste gives off :00
You should invite Celeste over
All these celeste jokes and nobody's stopping him from burning monomi's things,,,
so much feels in 1 pic 🔥
Someone stop him from burning monomi's stuff. 'Cause i aint ;3
@its.me.hizashii Gyahaha, who cares?
@mcramencos uhm, like the smell of a goth burning alive, puhu
@monokumasdayoff you should sell it at hot topics- The emos would love the smell of a goth burning :0! And you get a nice profit pff
@raynemorris I miss playing that game I hate my Xbox is down right now
Gotta love giggling objects too!
@wretched64 lmao 😂 no shit on that one. All they do is bounce ha ha. When I'm fighting I'm always yelling watch my puppies!
@wickett1221 what did you do to it?
@raynemorris lol haven't heard them called that in a while lol
@raynemorris I didn’t do anything to it the htmi port stopped working
@wretched64 hey some of those puppies are huge
@wickett1221 that can be replaced
@raynemorris I kno just don’t have the money to have it fixed right now

Nice design 👌
What a beauty💚🔥
I had one 😍
@infiniteascension just googled the mountain dew Limited Edition... Looks epic af😲... Was it america only?
@simon_usa2016 kind of
@zach_michalski_58 shotguns are supposed to be close range option where you don't  have to aim in to get a kill id say it doesn't take much skill but in ella's case i think you have to go with the shotty on her because sub has way to much recoil to use at longer range so the shotty is a better choice for close range.
@zach_michalski_58 😂😂 that was funny
They should work on hitbox consistency instead of nerfing ops
Are they going to nerf it again?! Wtf
Yall forgetin alibi and maestro's 30 round mag full auto shotty
@superabbidd no
Rip bb has take so many nerfs to the face
Menacing on console, but the game is balanced for high tier PC play. Thats why bb gets nerfs. In a 1 shot headshot game, he's a fundamentally broken operator.
@cristhefishh you know why? Because you can't spam the British shotgun like you can with Ela's
@hudson_james_allen dude it's not even that good on PC, it's just console where it tears people to shreds because it requires general aim not 100% accuracy
@doctheroamer your point?
@ben.mrstealyourgirl I agree shotgun don't really require to be aimed but the only shotguns that should be allowed to kill someone from a decent distance in terms of shotguns are pumps not full autos, which her shotgun is capable of doing. If you are 2 feet from her I'm fine with dying because I would with all guns but I don't die from 2 feet from her, she shoots me from like 20 feet away and kills me in 2-4 shots. I especially hate her on maps where there is an unnecessary amount of rooms so you don't have time to drone them all so as you push obj she can hit you from behind and is capable of shredding your whole team in 5 seconds.
Ella shotgun is garbo
Broken af ubi hate console Bruvs
@bacon_lizard you couldn’t be more wrong my friend
@ohasky what's ur username. Let's look you up
@zach_michalski_58 U have drones
@doctheroamer get better
@torabe_inkin dont get everything nerfed because you cant handle it 🤷‍♂️
@doctheroamer it’s a fucking shotgun. Yes it should shred at close range. The same thing happens with the British shotgun but no one bats an eye
@hudson_james_allen Yeah but its not a realistic game. Also , most shotguns in siege use buckshots so they dont have that much of a range, the ones who use slugs (vigil) have to much range.
@guy.ben.zvi if you're looking for a realistic game , play escape from tarkov.
@guy.ben.zvi buck shot still shoots 50 yards...and it was, once upon a time. Its getting less and less realistic as people get shit nerfed and they come out with shit opps
@hudson_james_allen quick question, have you ever actually played siege
@hudson_james_allen it isn't realistic at all, it's all about balancing and gameplay, not realism. In reality a blowtorch can't cut through thick metal instantly with no noise or Sparks. In reality a drone can't hover, go invisible on the ceiling and shoot shock waves. In reality an AR could shoot across any map in siege and the damage not drop off but it still does. Play the game, than you can start getting triggered over people shitting on the only weapon you can use. A gun that takes no skill because it shoots as fast as you can pull the trigger and can shred someone super far away
@simon_usa2016 you mean other than completely making shields irrelevant? They literally can't fight back anymore. You wanna hip fire point blank someone? Nope you shoot 10 feet to the right. You wanna ads someone? Nope it takes like 2 seconds to ads and by the time you finally start aiming you are already dead. Ash acog removal did fuck all. Most people I know used Holo for the RC anyways. The acog was too zoomed in to push as effectively as a Holo or red dot
I feel like the people who defend the Ela shotty and get triggered over it are the people who hide in corners waiting for someone to peak just to unload like 11 shots with the shotty in 2 seconds.
@zach_michalski_58 shields should be support and not solo beasts... How do you counter them otherwise... I prefer zoomed in always and I've been called a hacker with ACOG several times prenerf. Holo/Reddot is OK but it isn't as versatile for me as ACOG was, it was rare that I would get in a fight where I'm uncomfortable with the zoom (people in a distance of below like 4m) and I rather slightly struggle at short range than not seeing shit at long range
@zach_michalski_58 it works my guy u just mad cuz you rush and don't drone out
@simon_usa2016 it depends on maps and guns. Small maps with close quarters and as an Ash you won't need an acog, buck on maps like coastline. When I play someone with a full auto weapon I use Holo all the time because I don't ever try to snipe people, spawn kill, or run out.
I've never even encountered an Ela Shotty. The blackbeard buff that kept his movement speed consistent while having the shield up was stupid because now hes basically a normal operator with an extra 1-2 bullets needed on the head.
@zach_michalski_58 yeah try to counter a doc spawn peeking or sth like that is way easier with an ACOG. And I don't really feel any disadvantages, also which aspect ratio do you use?
@simon_usa2016 I usually play on console because my friends play on it, but I don't remember what I had it on PC, I had the highest graphics settings possible though
@zach_michalski_58 oh OK yeah do you know the 4:3 thing?
The shotgun is horrible. It needs like 3 shots+ to kill but has high recoil. Ur just bad if u csnt counter
@ben.mrstealyourgirl I know it works, and a little to well, that's why the shotgun needs to get a rate of fire nerf.Also I rarely ever rush, It depends on the other teams room and ops. Plus I don't have the ability to drone usually, I have one drone watching the flank, and the other gets killed by someone.
@ben.mrstealyourgirl just takes zero skill to be able to kill someone instantly without aiming
@ohasky broski Ela shotty is a semi auto pump shotgun
@justinpitman101 I main Ela and use both the Scorpion Evo and FO-12. It’s not that bad, you just hold hard angles against people who use her shotgun (as you should any shotgun anyway) so less BBs can hit you. If the players I’m playing against use hard angles I’ll equip the Evo. On attack I’ll use Twitch, Hibana, Zofia, or Jackal (if he’s not banned) I’ll use Jackal’s shotgun because that thing has insane range. Twitch and Lion’s shotgun is a great way to counter Ela’s shotgun too just because the range and damage. Just an FYI: I haven’t seen anything from the siege community about this but the shotgun pattern changed this season. Originally it was 8 BBs in a square pattern, now it is 7 in a triangular pattern and one in the center.
@dicusbrandon did you really call pellets, BBs?
@lispyricky if reading through all of that and only getting “this person called them BBs hahaha” it’s kinda petty...
@lispyricky also my bad for making a mistake 🤦‍♂️ im only human...
You guys still play siege after Ubisoft nerfing ever character ? That is why they get away with this shit
@ohasky exactly
It's not OP shut up!!!
ITS A SHOTGUN YES IT SHOULD SHOOT 10 FEET. GOD YALL MAKE ME MAD. ITS. A. SHOTGUN. STOP GETTING THEM ALL NERFED, THEY SUCK AS IS.
@justinpitman101 you're bad
@a_silas_ this comment deserves all the likes
@hudson_james_allen I'm plat 2 but ok
@justinpitman101 😂😂that was funny
No pls
@ohasky nigga that thing is a BEAST !
@a_silas_ why shouldn't they nerf OP Ops? The only nerf I disagree with is Ash ACOG Removal, besides that, what did they nerf that didn't deserve it
@hudson_james_allen yesterday this guy was behind the shield peeking thru one of the slits. He jumped up and might aswell have torn me to shreds with the shotgun and I had no chance to fight back.
@doctheroamer that's your fault for positioning yourself wrong, why should the shotgun suck so you can do better? Do you hear yourself? It's a shotgun.  Shotguns in real life have an effective range of 50 yards. In this game it's like 15 to 20 feet  so you're just bad .
That’s so true
it isn't even that broken quit bitching about it
@ohasky probably the same kid who is a silver and never sees people use them
@justinpitman101 platinum 1 atm diamond every season,you wanna look me up on r6 stats?
@ohasky then you're lucky as shit because I'm plat and I see and ela with shotgun sniping people from down a hallway with that thing
@justinpitman101 i mean of course it will do enough damage to down you if they empty the whole damn clip but if they consistently do then they run kit of ammo very quickly, Now the real problem is the super one shot 90 and smoke shotty those are real snipers
@ohasky I've never had to deal with any of that tbh, the smoke shotgun is ight, and the super 90 is meh, the ela shotgun has too much damage over range compared to other shotguns, I've been one shot from across a room with that thing without a headshot
@ohasky I dont mean to butt in but I think the main problem is the rate of fire

Agreed! Tg16 & Genesis even tho I own all 3
For Shooters Turbo and Genesis all day long 👍🏻. The SNES has a half dozen amazing quality shooters but it’s slim pickings after that. Awesome Shelfie as always 👍🏻
I had a turbo grafx 16
As a die hard Nintendo fan growing up I’ve come to see the light over the last few years and now 100% agree

Diablos... suena increible 😮
Un tiro al piso. Con toda la nostalgia Retro que hay esto se vende como pan caliente.  Salvo en pc que lo van a bajar todos más piratas que le chuck

@lucioallendes10 ❤️
@jose_alday_ 👏
@aquino_gasty06 pasa 🤣
Siempre es una buena noticia cuando los colegas amplían coleccion👏👏👏
Ostras no me acordaba de este juego🤩🤩,lo jugue cuando era un crio.Eso es bueno lo de ampliar la colección 😁.Disfrutalo crack!!!
@vidaextraretro Muchas gracias, da gusto ver como se amplia poco a poco aunque voy lento con Master el problema es el espacio 😂
@el_rincon_de_los_frikies Muchas gracias, el de Megadrive nunca lo he jugado pero he visto videos y que guapo😜🔥
Classic 💯
Me acuerdo de este de verlo en la Mega y me molaba 😊😊😊. El de Master imagino que será del pelo 👌🏻. Ya cerca de los 100 👏🏻
Pues no lo conocía, tengo que hecharle un vistazo!😊🔥🤘
@llishulsh Si cerca de los 100 ya🙌 la versión de Mega es distinta y superior 🔝
@alisontyon Yeah!!!!
@retrojuegazos Míratelo, aunque su versión de Megadrive me flipa tengo que ir a por el!
Cool game 👍
Great to meet and chat with you
Carmageddon is way rarer then it gets credit for
@j_biddles Same 👍🏻
@anthonyxmarinaro right then when you do find it the label is always fucked.
Glad you finally finished the 64 set, happy for you!
@_strychnine lol I still didn’t
Lmao, also great seeing you beat Contra. Had a blast though man, Justin is gonna kidnap you for the last flea market.
